<div class="fs90">
<p>Daniel Webster, in his Autobiography, speaks thus of his entering
upon the study of law: "I was put to study in the old way&mdash;that is,
the hardest books first, and lost much time. I read Coke on Littleton
through without understanding a quarter part of it. Happening
to take up Espinasse's Law of Nisi Prius, I found I could understand
it; and arguing that the object of reading was to understand
what was written, I laid down the venerable Coke <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et alios similes reverendos</i>,
and kept company for a time with Mr. Espinasse and others,
the most plain, easy, and intelligible writers. A boy of twenty, with
no previous knowledge on such subjects, can not understand Coke.
It is folly to set him on such an author. There are propositions in
Coke so abstract, and distinctions so nice, and doctrines embracing
so many conditions and qualifications, that it requires an effort, not
only of a mature mind, but of a mind both strong and mature, to understand
him. Why disgust and discourage a boy by telling him
that he must break into his profession through such a wall as this?
I really often despaired. I thought that I never could make myself a
lawyer, and was almost going back to the business of schoolkeeping.
Mr. Espinasse, however, helped me out of this in the way that I have
mentioned, and I have always felt greatly obliged to him."</p>

<p>Here is most graphically depicted a defect which is now, as it was
then, very prominent in all departments of education. It is even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
more so in early education than in that of the college and the professional
school. Even in tender childhood pupils are put to studying
books of which, as was true of Webster with his Coke on Littleton,
they do not understand "a quarter part." If the rule is not
"the hardest books first," there are many things in the books that it
is not only hard but impossible for them to understand. And the
hardest things are often put first. For example, in a very popular
primary geography which lies before me the pupil is introduced to
the world and its grand divisions at the outset, while he is taught
about his own state and country only at the conclusion of the book.
And this unnatural mode is the one very commonly pursued. Similar
criticism can be passed upon most of the books used in teaching
young children. Some of them are wholly useless. This is true of
the grammars for primary schools. The formal statements, called
the rules of grammar, are beyond the understanding of very young
scholars, and therefore are useless burdens upon their memories.
They are as useless to them as the three-fourths of Coke which Webster
could not understand was to him.</p>

<p>If we follow education, upward from the primary school we find the
same defect throughout the whole course. In the books which are
used in teaching natural science it is especially prominent. Even in
the elementary books, or compendiums, so called, formal propositions
and technical terms render the study uninviting, and to a great extent
unintelligible. The pupil is apt to be disgusted and discouraged,
as Webster was with Coke on Littleton, and for the same reason.</p>

<p>Another defect intimately connected with that of which I have
spoken is the very sparing and late introduction of the physical sciences.
They are generally postponed to the latter part of the course
of education, and then but little time is devoted to them. Generally,
when a pupil designs to go through college, the study of these sci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>ences
is wholly neglected in his preparation, because a knowledge of
them is not required for admission. Then in the college they are not
attended to till the latter part of the course, and in the short time allotted
to them there is so much to be learned that the teaching of
them is a failure. Especially is this true of Chemistry and Geology.</p>

<p>This defect is a <em>radical</em> one. A thorough change should be effected
in this respect in the whole course of education. The natural sciences
should be made prominent from the beginning to the end, not
only because they are of practical value, but also because they are as
useful in their way for mental discipline as the study of mathematics
and of language. They can be taught to some little extent to the
youngest pupils. There are facts about air, water, and the various
objects that they see around them, which they can understand if they
be presented in the right manner. And the busy inquiries which
they make after the reasons of the facts, and their appreciation of
them if stated simply and without technical terms, show the appropriateness
of such teaching. Children are really very good philosophers
in their way. They have great activity not only of their perceptive
but of their reasoning faculties also, to which due range should
be given in their education.</p>

<p>Beginning thus, not a year should pass during the whole course
when the pupil shall not be engaged in studying some one of the
physical sciences to some extent. This continued attention to such
studies in a reasonable amount, so far from interfering with the due
prosecution of the other studies deemed so essential, <em>will so promote
the pupil's advance in them as to more than make up for the time that is
taken from them</em>. It will do this not only by the genial influence
which such studies exert upon the mind, but by the contributions
which they make to the knowledge of language and mathematics;
for language is largely built up from natural objects and from the ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>quisitions
of science, and there is an abundance of interesting applications
of portions of the mathematics in the facts which the physical
sciences develop to us.</p>

<p>I have said that the teaching of the natural sciences in our colleges
is generally a failure, and it always will be so as long as the present
plan is continued. In order to have it successful there must be <em>the
same gradation in teaching them that we have in teaching language and
the mathematics</em>. The college student needs to be prepared for the
lectures which he hears on natural philosophy, chemistry, etc., and
for his study of those branches, by previous familiarity with the simpler
portions of them acquired in the school-room.</p>

<p>There is another very important reason for the early introduction
of the physical sciences into education. By far the larger portion of
pupils in our schools stop short of the college, or even the academy
and high school. That they should go forth into the world with no
knowledge of the principles that lie at the basis of the arts in which
so many of them are to engage is a shame and a wrong, if the communication
of such knowledge be indeed practicable, as it undoubtedly
is. Even those who are not to engage in these arts will be
greatly benefited by this knowledge, because in addition to its constant
practical applications in the management of life, it will contribute
to their mental power, and, what is no small consideration,
to their enjoyment; and it is in fact requisite to constitute them
well-informed persons.</p>

<p>If the views which I have presented be correct, there should be a
series of books on the natural sciences carefully adapted to the different
periods of the course of study. Those intended for the young
beginner should be exceedingly simple, and should not attempt to
present any thing like a full view of the subjects treated. They
should deal largely with familiar facts or phenomena. The termin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>ology
of science and formal statements of principles, such as we often
see in so-called compendiums, should have no place in them, but
should be gradually introduced as the series advances, and should be
made complete only in the concluding books.</p>

<p>It has been the object of the author to supply a part of such a
series. The first book in the series is the "Child's Book of Common
Things," intended to teach the observation of familiar facts, or, in
other words, the beginnings of philosophy, to children as soon as they
have got well started in reading. Next comes the "Child's Book of
Nature," which in its three parts (Part I., Plants; Part II., Animals;
Part III., Air, Water, Light, Heat, etc.) extends considerably
the knowledge of the philosophy of things which the child has obtained
from the first book in the series. Then follows the "First
Book in Chemistry." On a level with this is my "First Book in
Physiology." The next step in the gradation brings us to three
books under one title, "Science for the School and the Family;"
Part I., Natural Philosophy; Part II., Chemistry; Part III., Mineralogy
and Geology. On a level with these is another book, "Natural
History," and another still is to be written, an "Introduction to
Botany."</p>

<p>The three books, of which the present is one, are intended for the
older scholars in what are commonly called grammar-schools. At
the same time they are suited to scholars who are advanced to a
higher grade who have not gone through the previous books of the
series. The preparation of books especially adapted to high schools
and colleges I have left to others, except in one branch of science,
Physiology, on which I some years ago published a work entitled
"Human Physiology."</p>

<p>All of these books are from the press of Harper and Brothers
except the two works on Physiology, published by Sheldon and Co.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
New York, and the "Child's Book of Common Things," published
by Peck, White, and Peck, New Haven.</p>

<p>The general plan and style of these books are very different from
what we see in most of the books for schools on the same subjects.
The order of the subjects and the mode of developing them differ
from the stereotype plan which has so generally been adopted. One
prominent feature is the free use of illustrations from <em>familiar</em> phenomena.
This leads the pupil to reason or philosophize about common
things, thus giving an eminently practical character to his
knowledge. At the same time it makes the books suitable for use
in the family as well as the school, between which there should be
more common ground than the present mode of education allows.</p>

<p>The style which I have chosen for all the books I have written for
use in teaching is what may be called the <em>lecture style</em>. There are
three other kinds of style which are more commonly used in school-books.
The most common is what I term the <em>formal statement style</em>.
In this principles and rules are stated, and then illustrations are
given. This makes a formal and uninviting book. The bare skeleton
of the science is generally for the most part presented, and the
young pupil is apt to learn the statements by rote without understanding
them. It is a style fitted only for books intended for advanced
scholars. Another style is the <em>catechetical</em>. This is an unnatural
mode of communicating knowledge; and besides, it encourages
learning by rote as the formal statement style does. In the
third style, the <em>dramatic</em>, conversations are held between the teacher
and some learners. The chief objection to this is that it undertakes
to put in permanent shape what should be extemporized in the recitation.
What is needed in the book is simply clear and concise
statement in an interesting style, and the living teacher and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
scholars can best furnish the conversational element as the recitation
goes on.</p>

<p>In the lecture style there may be and should be as much precision
of statement as in the formal statement style, while it is more interesting,
because it is the natural mode of communicating knowledge.
In this style the facts are ordinarily so stated as to develop principles;
while in the other the order is reversed, the principles being first stated
and the facts given afterward. One of the most successful books ever
used in our colleges&mdash;"Paley's Natural Theology"&mdash;is in the lecture
style, and it is a matter of surprise that this fact has had so little influence
with those who have prepared books for instruction.</p>

<p>Whatever may be true of advanced scholars, in teaching the young
student in science bare, dry statement should be avoided, and the
subjects should be presented in all their attractive features. I would
not be understood as advocating the dressing up of science in adventitious
charms. This is not necessary. Science possesses in itself an
abundance of charms, which need only to be properly developed to
attract the young mind; and the lecture style furnishes the best vehicle
for such a development.</p>

<p>One grand essential for giving interest to any study is the presentation
of the various points in the <em>natural order</em> in which they should
enter the mind. <em>They should be so presented that each portion of a
book shall make the following portions more interesting and more easily
understood.</em> This principle, which is so commonly transgressed, I
have endeavored to observe strictly in the preparation of these volumes.</p>

<p>Questions are put at the end of this book for those teachers who
desire to use them. There is also an Index.</p>

1. <b>Matter and Spirit.</b>&mdash;The distinction between matter
and spirit is almost universally recognized even by
those who have given little thought to such subjects.
It is a distinction of which we are conscious in our own
persons. We know instinctively that there is a something
within us that causes the movements of our material
bodies, and that something we call spirit.</p>

<p><a name="P_2" id="P_2"></a>
2. <b>Bishop Berkeley's Ideas.</b>&mdash;Some philosophers, in
their speculations, have denied that there is any such
thing in existence as matter. Bishop Berkeley, for example,
taught that the impressions which we suppose
that we receive from material objects do not come from
real substances, but are the "effects of the immediate
agency of an ever-present Deity." It is no wonder that
the wisdom and learning of a man who could seriously
adopt such a belief could not save him from being the
dupe of quackery. He believed that tar-water was a
sovereign cure for all diseases; and Dr. Holmes playfully
remarks of him, that "he held two very odd opinions:
that tar-water was every thing, and that the whole
material universe was nothing."</p>

<p><a name="P_3" id="P_3"></a>
3. <b>Hume's Ideas.</b>&mdash;The infidel Hume went beyond
Bishop Berkeley, denying even the existence of the soul
as an individual and responsible agent. He made every
thing to consist of ideas and impressions, and said that
these have no necessary connection, but are "a bundle
of perceptions that succeed each other with inconceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
rapidity, and that therefore I myself of to-day am no
more the I myself of yesterday or to-morrow than I am
Nebuchadnezzar or Cleopatra." A wag proposed the
following epitaph for his tomb-stone as a suitable illustration
of his theory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">"Under this circular idea, vulgarly called tomb,</p>
<p class="verse">Impressions and ideas rest which constituted Hume."</p>
</div></div>

<p><a name="P_4" id="P_4"></a>
4. <b>Origin of the word Spirit.</b>&mdash;The name spirit came
originally from an attenuated form of matter, the air or
breath, because the air, like spiritual existence, is invisible.
The formation of language is to a large extent thus
based on analogies.</p>

<p><a name="P_5" id="P_5"></a>
5. <b>Spirit not an Object of Sense.</b>&mdash;None of the senses
can perceive spirit itself, though they perceive the effects
which spirit produces on material substances. If, for
example, you move your arm, it is the spirit within you,
acting upon the muscles through the nerves, that causes
it to move; and you see here the effects produced by
spirit upon matter, but you do not see the spirit itself.</p>

<p><a name="P_6" id="P_6"></a>
6. <b>Effects of Matter on the Senses.</b>&mdash;Some forms of
matter can be perceived by all the senses; others can be
perceived by only a part of them; some by only one.
Air you can not see, nor smell, nor taste; but you can
feel it, and hear the sound of its motion. Sometimes
matter affects only the sense of smell, or that with the
sense of taste. Sea-air smells salt; but the salt in the
air is so finely divided that we can not see it. And yet
it is the salt, entering the nostrils and coming in contact
with the extreme fibres of the nerve of smell, that produces
the effect. So when we smell a flower, matter
comes from it in particles so fine that no microscope can
detect them, but they produce sensation when they strike
upon the nerve.</p>

<p><a name="P_7" id="P_7"></a>
7. <b>Forms of Matter.</b>&mdash;Matter appears in three forms:
solid, liquid, and gaseous or aeriform&mdash;that is, like air.
Sometimes matter is spoken of as having only two forms&mdash;solid
and fluid. In this case fluids are divided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
two classes, the elastic and non-elastic. The air and the
various gases and vapors are the elastic fluids; while
those which are called liquids are the non-elastic fluids.
A foot-ball bounds because the air in it is an elastic fluid.
If it were filled with a non-elastic fluid; as water, it would
not bound. When water takes the form of steam it is
an elastic fluid. Though it is very common to use the
expression elastic fluids, the division of matter into three
forms is the one usually recognized.</p>

<p><a name="P_8" id="P_8"></a>
8. <b>Solids.</b>&mdash;In solid matter the particles can not be
moved about among each other; but each particle generally
retains the same position in relation to those particles
which are around it&mdash;in other words, it does not
change its neighborhood. This is more true of some
solids than of others. It is absolutely true of such hard
solids as granite and the diamond. In these the particles
are always in the same relative position. But it is
not so with gold or lead. By hammering these you can
change greatly the relative position of their particles.
India-rubber is a solid, but the relative position of its
particles can be much altered in various ways.</p>

<p><a name="P_9" id="P_9"></a>
9. <b>Liquids.</b>&mdash;It is the grand characteristic of a liquid
that its particles change their relative position from the
slightest causes. It is in strong contrast with solids in
this respect. When you move any portion of a solid
body you move all the other portions of it, and generally
in the same direction. But a body of liquid can not be
moved all together as one body except by confining it;
as, for example, in the case of a water-pipe or a syringe.
And then, the moment that the water can escape, the
particles use their liberty of altering their relative position.
As wind and other agents act continually upon
water, no particle stays for any length of time in the
neighborhood of the same particles. "Unstable as water"
is, then, an exceedingly significant expression. Water
is never at rest. A particle of it may at one time be
floating on the surface of the ocean, and at another be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in depths beyond the sounding of man. It flies on the
wings of the wind, falls in the rain, runs in the stream,
is exhaled from a leaf, trembles in the dew-drop, flows in
the blood of an animal or in the sap of a plant, and is
always ready to be jostled along in its ever-changing
course.</p>

<p><a name="P_10" id="P_10"></a>
10. <b>Gases.</b>&mdash;The particles of gaseous or aeriform substances
move among each other even more freely than
those of a liquid. Air, therefore, is more unstable and
restless than water. Even when the air seems to be perfectly
still its particles are moving about among each
other. You can see this to be true if you darken a room,
leaving a single shutter a little open. Where the light
enters you will see motes flying about in every direction,
which would not be the case if the air were really at rest.
The particles of air have a greater range of travel than
those of water; for the sea of atmosphere which envelops
the earth rises to the height of about fifty miles.
How far water rises in its evaporation we know not;
but it is not at all probable that it rises to the uppermost
regions of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a name="P_11" id="P_11"></a>
11. <b>Filling of Spaces by Liquids and Gases.</b>&mdash;It is the
freeness with which the particles of liquids and gases
move among each other that enables them to insinuate
themselves into spaces every where. They are ever
ready to enter into any substances which have interstices
or pores of such size as will admit them. There are
mingled with the grains of the soil not only water, but
air and gases. These are present also in all living substances,
both vegetable and animal. Water is the chief
part of sap and of blood, and air and gases always go
with water. Part of the air that we breathe in enters
the blood in the lungs, and courses with it through the
system. The fishes could not live in water if there were
not air mingled with it. This can be proved by experiment.
If you put a fish into a close vessel it will soon
die, because it uses up all the air that is in the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
In an open vessel the fish is kept alive by the constant
accessions of fresh air to the water.</p>

<p><a name="P_12" id="P_12"></a>
12. <b>Solution.</b>&mdash;In solutions of solid substances in water
it is the freedom with which the particles of water
move about among each other that enables them to take
in among them the minute particles of the solid. And
when water ascends into air by evaporation it may be
said to be a real solution of water in the air; for the
particles of water mingle with those of the air, just as
the particles of a solid mingle with those of water in a
solution.</p>

<p><a name="P_13" id="P_13"></a>
13. <b>Relation of Heat to the Forms of Matter.</b>&mdash;Some
kinds of matter are seen in all the three forms. Whether
these shall assume one form or another depends on the
amount of heat present. Thus when water is solid, ice,
it is because a part of its heat is gone. Apply heat, and
it becomes a liquid, water. Increase the heat to the
boiling point, and it becomes steam, or an aeriform substance.
Alcohol has only two forms&mdash;liquid and aeriform.
It has never been known to be frozen. Iron is
usually solid; but in the foundry, by the application of
great heat, it is made liquid. Mercury is liquid in all
ordinary temperatures; but it often becomes solid in the
extreme cold of arctic winters. A mercurial thermometer
is of course useless under such circumstances, and
the alcoholic thermometer is relied upon to denote the
degree of cold. The difference between mercury, water,
and iron in regard to the liquid state is this: It takes
but little heat, comparatively, to make mercury liquid,
while more is required for this condition in water, and
much more for it in the case of iron.</p>

<p><a name="P_14" id="P_14"></a>
14. <b>The Nature of Matter Unknown.</b>&mdash;What now, let
us inquire, do we know of the nature of matter? Can
we say that we know any thing of it? We may observe
its phenomena, and learn its properties; but with our
most searching analyses of it we can no more determine
what matter is than we can what spirit is. Newton sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>posed
"that God in the beginning formed matter in
solid, massy, hard, impenetrable particles." This he believed
to be true of liquids, and even of gases, as well as
solids. In the gas these hard particles are much farther
apart than in the solid. The supposition is a very probable
one; but if it be true it does not let us know what
matter is, for it leaves us in the dark as to the nature of
the particles. Newton farther supposed that these particles
have always remained unaltered amidst all the
changes that are taking place; these changes being occasioned
by "the various separations and new associations
and motions of these permanent particles." When,
for example, any thing is burned up, as it is expressed,
not one of these particles is either destroyed or altered,
but they merely take on new arrangements. Though
most of the substance has flown off in the form of gas,
the ultimate particles composing the gas are the same
now that they were when making a part of the solid substance;
and they may soon again become a part of some
new solids. Such changes in the forms of matter are
every where going on; and when you become acquainted
with Chemistry, in the Second Part, you will be familiar
with them.</p>

<p><a name="P_15" id="P_15"></a>
15. <b>Atomic Theory.</b>&mdash;These ultimate particles of matter
are so minute that they have never been seen by man.
The smallest particle that can be seen with the most
powerful microscope is probably made up of very many
of them united together. These ultimate particles we
term atoms; and the theory in regard to the composition
by them of different substances is called the atomic theory.
The atoms of different substances are not supposed
to be alike, but to differ in both size and weight. This
theory will be more particularly noticed in the Second
Part.</p>

<p><a name="P_16" id="P_16"></a>
16. <b>Imponderable Agents.</b>&mdash;There are certain agents&mdash;light,
heat, electricity, etc.&mdash;which are supposed by some
to be forms of matter. If they are, they are exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
attenuated; for their presence, as has been proved by
many experiments, never adds in the least to the weight
of any substance. They have therefore been styled imponderable
agents. Their agency is of great importance
and very active, producing every where constant changes.
Two of them&mdash;heat and light&mdash;are obviously and immediately
essential to life. What their real nature is remains
as yet an entire mystery.</p>

<span class="fs80">PROPERTIES OF MATTER.</span></h3>


<p><a name="P_17" id="P_17"></a>
17. <b>Variety in the Properties of Matter.</b>&mdash;All matter
has properties or qualities. Some of these are different
in the different kinds of matter. Thus its three forms
have different properties, as you saw in Chapter I. There
is variety also in the properties of substances of the same
class. Thus liquids are unlike each other in some respects.
Some, for example, are lighter than others. Oil
is lighter than water. Gaseous substances also differ in
this and in other respects. But the variety in the properties
of solids is greater than in those of gases or liquids.
This will appear as I proceed.</p>

<p><a name="P_18" id="P_18"></a>
18. <b>Divisibility of Matter.</b>&mdash;Any visible portion of
matter can be divided into parts. Even if it be so small
that you can see it only with a powerful microscope, it
could still be divided if you could have an instrument
sufficiently fine for the purpose. <em>Divisibility</em>, then, is
said to be a <em>general</em> property of matter; that is, a property
belonging to all kinds of matter.</p>

<p><a name="P_19" id="P_19"></a>
19. <b>Examples of Minute Division of Matter.</b>&mdash;There
are numerous examples in which the division of matter
is carried far beyond that which can be effected by any
cutting instrument. Some of these I will notice:</p>

<p>A gold-beater can hammer a grain of gold into a leaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
covering a space of fifty square inches. So thin is it that
it would take 282,000 of such leaves, laid upon each other,
to make the thickness of an inch. And yet so even
and perfect is this thin layer of gold, that when it is laid
upon any surface in gilding it has the appearance of solid
gold. A fifty millionth part of this grain of gold thus
hammered out can be seen by the aid of a microscope
which magnifies the diameter of an object ten times. But
the division of gold is made even more minute than this
in the manufacture of the wire of gold-lace. It is done
in this way: A bar of silver weighing 180 ounces is covered
with a layer of gold weighing an ounce. It is then
drawn through a series of holes in a steel plate, diminishing
in diameter, till it at length comes out a very fine
wire 4000 feet long. Each foot of it then has only the
one 4000th part of the ounce of gold, and yet the silver
is well covered.</p>

<p>A soap-bubble is a beautiful example of the minute division
of matter. That thin wall which incloses the air
which you have blown into it is composed of particles of
the soap and of the water mingled together. It is supposed
to be less than one millionth of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>The thread of the silk-worm is so minute that the finest
sewing-silk is formed of many of these threads twisted
together. But the spider spins much more finely than
this. The thread by which you see him letting himself
down from any height is made up of about 6000 threads
or filaments, each coming from a separate hole in his
spinning machine. A quarter of an ounce of the thread
of a spider's web would extend 400 miles.</p>

<p>A grain of blue vitriol, dissolved in a gallon of water,
will make the whole blue. Such a diffusion could not be
without an exceedingly minute division of the particles.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most minute division of matter is exemplified
in odors. A grain of musk will scent a room for
years, and yet have no perceptible loss of weight. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
all this time the air is filled with fine particles coming
from the musk.</p>

<p>The microscope reveals to us many wonderful examples
of the minuteness of the particles of matter, both in
the vegetable and the animal world.</p>

<p>If you press a common puff-ball a dust flies off like
smoke. Examined with a microscope, each particle of
this dust, which is the seed of the plant, is a perfectly
round orange-colored ball. This ball is of course made
up of very many particles, arranged in this regular form.
Beautiful examples of various arrangements of the minute
particles of matter we have in the pollen of different
plants, as seen with the microscope.</p>

<p>Each particle of the dust which adheres to your fingers
as you catch a moth is a scale with fine lines upon it regularly
arranged. And if you look through the microscope
at the wing of the moth, you will see, where the
dust is rubbed off, the attachments by which the scales
were held standing up from the surface of the wing, like
nail-heads on a roof where the shingles have been torn off.</p>

<p>The organization of exceedingly small animals, as revealed
by the microscope, furnishes us with wonderful
examples of the minute division of matter. A little of
the dust of guano, examined through a powerful microscope,
is seen to contain multitudes of shells of various
shapes. These shells are the remains of animalcules that
lived in the water, their destiny seeming to be in part to
furnish food to other animals larger than themselves. In
the chalk formations of the earth are seen multitudes
of such shells. They have been discovered even in the
glazing of a visiting-card; for they are so small that the
fine grinding up of the chalk does not wholly destroy
them. There are animals, both in the air and in the water,
so small that it would take millions of them to equal
in bulk a gram of sand, and a thousand of them could
swim side by side through the eye of a common-sized
needle. Now in all these animals there are organs, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>structed
of particles of matter, which are arranged in
them with as much order and symmetry as in the organs
of our bodies. How minute then must these particles be!</p>

<p>How do such facts extend our views of the power of
the Deity! The same power that moulded the earth,
sun, moon, and the whole "host of heaven," gave form,
and life, and motion to the millions which sport in every
sunbeam; the same eye that watches the immense heavenly
bodies as they move on in their course, looks upon
one and all of these legions of animals in earth, air, and
water, though they are unseen by human eyes, seeing
that every particle shall take its right position, so that
this part of creation may with all the rest be pronounced
very good; and the same bountiful hand that dispenses
the means of life and enjoyment to the millions of the
human race, forgets not to minister to the brief life and
enjoyment of each one of these myriads of animalcules,
though they seem to be almost nothingness itself.</p>

<p><a name="P_20" id="P_20"></a>
20. <b>Pores and Spaces in Matter.</b>&mdash;In all matter there
are spaces about the particles. Those bodies which are
called porous have quite large spaces in them. But even
in those which are not commonly considered porous the
particles are by no means close together. A celebrated
experiment tried in Florence a long time ago showed
that there are spaces among the particles of so dense a
substance as gold sufficiently large to let water through
them. A hollow golden globe containing water was subjected
to great pressure, and its surface was bedewed
with the water that came out through the pores of the
gold. In all substances in which there are pores visible
to the naked eye, or by the aid of the microscope, there
are other spaces or interstices among the particles around
the pores. Indeed, it is supposed that there is space
around every ultimate particle or atom, and that no two
of these atoms are in actual contact. The fact that substances
which have no pores can be compressed into a
smaller space than they usually occupy shows that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
are spaces or interstices in them. Solids can be thus
compressed, some more than others. But the most compressible
substances are the gases and vapors. The
amount of space between their particles must be very
large to allow of so great compression.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="P_21" id="P_21"></a>
21. <b>Space in Gaseous Substances.</b>&mdash;We can have some
idea of the great amount of space in a gaseous or aeriform
substance by observing the difference between water
in its liquid and in its aeriform state. A cubic inch
of water, when it becomes steam, occupies 1696 times as
much room as it did when it
was water. The difference in
proportion is exhibited in Fig.
1, the inner circle representing
the water, and the outer
the steam into which it is converted.
Now the water is
not altered at all in its nature
by being changed into steam.
The particles are simply put
farther apart by the heat, and
as soon as the heat is withdrawn
they come together again to form water, or, in
other words, the steam is condensed into water. It is
plain, therefore, that the space between the particles is
1696 times as great in steam as it is in the water from
which the steam is made.</p>

22. <b>Solutions.</b>&mdash;When any substance, as sugar or salt,
is dissolved in water, its particles are diffused through
the spaces that exist between the particles of the water.
So also when water evaporates (§ 12), the particles of
water are diffused through the spaces between the particles
of the air. In like manner are the particles from an
odorous substance diffused in these spaces, and thus mingled
with the particles of the air they are carried into the
nostrils, and strike upon the minute extremities of the
nerve of smell.</p>

23. <b>Relation of Heat to the Spaces of Matter.</b>&mdash;The
variation in the amount of space between the particles
of matter in any substance generally depends on the variation
of the amount of heat present. Thus heat expands
iron; that is, it increases the spaces between the
particles of the iron. So also heat increases the spaces
between the particles of mercury, and thus makes it occupy
more room in the thermometer. This effect of heat
will be considered more fully hereafter.</p>

<p>The general views which I have given of the constitution
of matter will throw light upon the different qualities
of different substances, some of which I will notice.</p>

<p><a name="P_24" id="P_24"></a>
24. <b>Density and Rarity.</b>&mdash;The density of a substance
depends upon the quantity of matter it contains in a given
space. The more dense, therefore, a substance is the
greater is its weight. A piece of lead is forty times heavier
than a piece of cork of the same size. Mercury is
nearly fourteen times heavier than an equal bulk of water.
You see, then, that density must depend on the nearness
of the atoms to each other. In so dense a substance
as gold the atoms are all very close together; in wood
there are spaces, some of which are so large that you
can see them; and in air, steam, and the gases there is a
great deal of space among the particles (§ 21), so that
we speak of their <em>rarity</em> instead of their density.</p>

<p><a name="P_25" id="P_25"></a>
25. <b>Tenacity.</b>&mdash;The power of holding together, termed
tenacity, depends on the degree of attraction between
the particles. By attraction I mean a disposition in particles
to come together, this disposition being manifested
in opposition to any force tending to draw them apart.
I shall soon speak of this more particularly. Tenacity
does not exist at all in gaseous substances. The particles
of air and of steam, for example, show no disposition to
cling together; that is, have no tenacity. This property
is weak in liquids. It is only strong enough in water to
enable its particles to hang together in the shape of a
drop. It is strong in solids, enabling their particles not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
only to hold together in large quantities, but to hold up
also heavy weights suspended to them. It is stronger in
iron than in any other solid. It is stronger in wrought
iron than in cast iron; and strongest of all in steel.</p>

<p><a name="P_26" id="P_26"></a>
26. <b>Comparative Tenacity of Substances.</b>&mdash;Various metals
and other substances have been tested in reference
to their comparative tenacity. It was done in this way:
Wires were made of the metals, all of the same size.
Weights were suspended to them, and additions were
made to the weights by little and little till the wires
broke. The table underneath was made by placing
against each metal the greatest weight that its wire
would hold:</p>

<p class="noindent">Oak wood, tried in the same way, was found to hold up
12 pounds, one more pound than silver. Some animal
substances have great tenacity, as the thread of the silk-worm,
hair, wool, and the ligaments and tendons of our
bodies and of other animals.</p>

<p><a name="P_27" id="P_27"></a>
27. <b>Value of Tenacious Substances.</b>&mdash;"The gradual
discovery," says Dr. Arnot, "of substances possessed of
strong tenacity, and which man could yet easily mould
and apply to his purposes, has been of great importance
to his progress in the arts of life. The place of the
hempen cordage of European navies is still held in China
by twisted canes and strips of bamboo; and even the
hempen cable of Europe, so great an improvement on
former usage, is now rapidly giving way to the more
complete and commodious security of the iron chain&mdash;of
which the material to our remote ancestors existed
only as useless stone or earth. And what a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
spectacle is it, at the present day, to behold chains of tenacious
iron stretched high across a channel of the ocean,
as at the Menai Strait between Anglesea and England,
and supporting an admirable bridge-road of safety, along
which crowded processions may pour, regardless of the
deep below, or of the storm; while ships there, with
sails full-spread, pursue their course unmolesting and
unmolested."</p>

<p><a name="P_28" id="P_28"></a>
28. <b>Hardness.</b>&mdash;This property seems to depend upon
some peculiar arrangement of the particles of matter.
We should suppose that the densest substances would
be the hardest. But it is not so. Iron is the hardest
of the metals, but its particles are not so close together
as those of gold, which is quite a soft metal. And gold
is five times as heavy as the diamond, which is so hard
as to cut glass easily. Common flint is hard enough to
scratch glass, but will not cut it like the diamond.</p>

29. <b>Flexibility and Brittleness.</b>&mdash;If you bend a flexible
body as a piece of wood,
as represented in Fig. 2, it
is obvious that the particles
on the upper or convex side
must be put a little farther
apart, while those on the under or concave side are
brought a little nearer together. But the wood does
not break, because the particles that are thus moved a
little apart still retain their hold upon each other. This
is the explanation of what we call flexibility. On the
other hand, the particles in a rod of glass can not be put
farther apart in this way. They are not actually in contact
any more than the particles of the wood are (§ 20),
but they are in a <em>fixed</em> relative position; that is, a position
which can not be disturbed without a <em>permanent</em>
separation of particles. If you attempt to bend the rod
there is no slight separation of many particles, as in the
bent wood, but a full and permanent separation in some
one part of the rod. We call the property on which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
result depends brittleness. Brittle substances are generally
hard. Glass, while the most brittle of all substances,
is hard enough to scratch iron. Brittle substances
also have much tenacity. A rod of glass can
hold up a heavy weight, although a slight blow suddenly
given would break it.</p>

<p><a name="P_30" id="P_30"></a>
30. <b>Flexible and Brittle Steel.</b>&mdash;There are two kinds of
steel, flexible and brittle. The steel of most cutting instruments
is brittle. The steel of a sword-blade is quite
flexible, and that of a watch-spring is so much so that
we can wind it up in a coil. This difference is owing to
a difference in the mode of cooling the steel. If it be
cooled suddenly, it is brittle; if slowly, it is flexible.
The process by which it is cooled slowly is called <em>annealing</em>.
The explanation of all this is quite plain. The
steel being expanded by heat&mdash;that is, its particles being
put farther apart than they usually are&mdash;when they are
suddenly brought together again they have not time to
arrange their relative position properly. Brittleness is
therefore the result. But, on the other hand, when the
cooling is effected gradually, time is given for the arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="P_31" id="P_31"></a>
31. <b>Tempering of Steel.</b>&mdash;Steel suddenly hardened is
too brittle for common use. A process called tempering
is therefore resorted to for diminishing the brittleness.
The steel is reheated after the hardening, and is then
allowed to cool slowly. The degree in which the brittleness
is lessened depends on the degree of heat to which
the steel is subjected. It can be entirely removed by a
red heat, for then the particles have a full opportunity to
readjust themselves; and the more the heat comes short
of this point the less thorough will be the adjustment,
because the less perfectly are the particles released from
their suddenly-taken position. In lessening the brittleness
we lessen hardness also, and therefore the tempering
is varied in different cases according to the degree of
hardness which is desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="P_32" id="P_32"></a>
32. <b>Annealing of Glass.</b>&mdash;Glass is always annealed. If
this were not done our glass vessels and windows would
be exceedingly brittle, and would therefore be constantly
breaking. Articles made of glass are annealed by being
passed very slowly indeed through a long oven which is
very hot at one end, the heat gradually lessening toward
the other end.</p>

33. <b>Prince Rupert's Drops.</b>&mdash;We have a striking example
of brittleness induced by sudden cooling in what
are called Prince Rupert's drops. These
are made by dropping melted green
glass into cold water, and they are of
the shape represented in Fig. 3. If you
break off ever so small a bit of the point
of one of these drops, the whole will at
once shiver to pieces. That is, the sudden
arrangement of the particles is so
slight and unnatural that the disturbance
of the arrangement in a small part suffices to destroy the
arrangement of the whole, very much as a row of bricks
falls over from the fall of the first in the row. Mr. Farraday
says that these drops were not, as is commonly
supposed, invented by Prince Rupert, but were first
brought to England by him in 1660. They excited
much curiosity at that time, and were considered "a
kind of miracle in nature." But you see that this, like
many other wonders, receives with a little thought an
easy explanation.</p>

<p><a name="P_34" id="P_34"></a>
34. <b>Malleability and Ductility.</b>&mdash;Those metals which
can be hammered into thin plates are called malleable.
Gold furnishes us with the best illustration of this property.
Silver, copper, and tin are quite malleable. Most
of the other metals are very little so, and some of them
are not at all, breaking at the first blow. A substance
is said to be <em>ductile</em> when it can be drawn out into wire.
The principal metals that have this quality are platinum,
silver, iron, copper, and gold, and in the order in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
I have named them. Melted glass is very ductile. It
can be drawn out in a very fine thread, and when this
thread is cut and arranged in branches it resembles beautiful
white hair. In hammering metals into plates, or
drawing them into wire, there is a considerable change
of relative position in the particles, similar to that which
we have in fluids, though nothing like as free. In this
change of position those particles that do remain in close
neighborhood have a remarkable tenacity or attraction,
preventing their separation. In welding two pieces of
iron, which is done by the blacksmith by hammering
them together when red-hot, there must be enough movement
among the particles to have those of one piece
mingle somewhat with those of the other.</p>

<p><a name="P_35" id="P_35"></a>
35. <b>Compressibility.</b>&mdash;Porous substances can be considerably
compressed. Force applied to them can bring
their particles nearer together, making them to fill up in
part their pores. The most familiar example you have
of this is in sponge. The more porous wood is the more
can it be compressed. But even such dense substances
as the metals can be compressed in some degree; that
is, the interstices between their particles can be made
smaller. Medals and coins have their figures and letters
stamped upon them by pressure, just as impressions are
made upon melted sealing-wax. The heavy and quick
pressure required to do this actually compresses the
whole piece of the hard metal, putting all the particles
nearer together, so that it occupies less space than it did
before it was stamped.</p>

<p><a name="P_36" id="P_36"></a>
36. <b>Incompressibility of Liquids.</b>&mdash;We should suppose,
from the freeness with which the particles of liquids
move among each other, and from the spaces (§ 22)
which exist among them, that these substances could be
easily compressed. But it is not so. The heaviest pressure
is required to compress them even in a slight degree.
Water can be compressed so very little that practically
it is regarded as incompressible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="P_37" id="P_37"></a>
37. <b>Influence of Heat on the Bulk of Liquids.</b>&mdash;Although
the interstices between the particles of liquids can not
be varied by mechanical pressure, they can be by variations
of temperature. Liquids are dilated or expanded
by heat; that is, their particles are put farther apart.
They are contracted or compressed by cold; that is,
their particles are brought nearer together by the abstraction
of heat. The most familiar example that we
have is in the thermometer. The mercury rises in the
tube when the heat increases the interstices between its
particles; and it falls when the loss of heat allows the
particles to come near together. The same effects are
seen when alcohol is used in the thermometer, as is done
in the arctic regions, because mercury may freeze there.
A thermometer with water in it would answer if we
wished only to measure temperatures between the freezing
point and the boiling point of water. The expansive
influence of heat will be particularly treated of hereafter.</p>

<p><a name="P_38" id="P_38"></a>
38. <b>Compressibility of Aeriform Substances.</b>&mdash;Aeriform
bodies are more compressible than any other substances,
showing that in their ordinary condition there is a great
deal of space among their particles. While they are thus
unlike liquids in compressibility, they are affected by
heat in the same way that liquids are.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="P_39" id="P_39"></a>
39. <b>Elasticity.</b>&mdash;Closely allied with the compressibility
of matter is its elasticity. We see this property strikingly
exemplified in India-rubber. It occasions the rebounding
of a ball of this substance when thrown down.
Observe flow exactly what occurs in this case. The ball
as it meets the resistance of the floor is flattened, as represented
in Fig. 4.
Then, as it assumes
the round shape, as
seen in Fig. 5, it pushes
downward upon the
floor. It is this sudden
pushing down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>ward
that makes it rebound. It is as if there were a
compressed spring between the ball and floor. It may
be likened also to jumping. When one jumps he bends
his limbs at the thigh and knee joints, and then, in
straightening himself up, gives a sudden push, like that
given by the ball as it assumes its round shape, and so
is thrown forward or upward, according to the direction
in which the pushing force is made. The same flattening
occurs in an ivory ball, though not to the same degree.
You can prove that it does occur by experiment. Let a
marble slab be wet and drop the ball upon it. Quite a
spot will be made dry by the blow of the ball, showing
that it touched more of the marble than it does when it
is merely placed upon it.</p>

<p><a name="P_40" id="P_40"></a>
40. <b>Elasticity Shown in Other Ways.</b>&mdash;If a stick be
bent, as in Fig. 2, as soon as the bending force is withdrawn
the stick becomes straight again from its elasticity.
It is this elastic force of the bow, straightening it, that
speeds the arrow. Observe in this case that while the
particles on the concave side of the bent bow are brought
nearer together or compressed, those on the convex side
are moved apart. This moving apart of the particles is
often shown in India-rubber. You can see how very far
apart particles that are in near neighborhood may be carried,
if you will stick two pins close together in a strip
of India-rubber before you stretch it.</p>

<p><a name="P_41" id="P_41"></a>
41. <b>Degrees of Elasticity in Different Substances.</b>&mdash;Some
substances have so very little elasticity that they
are practically considered as having none. Lead is one
of these. A rod of lead when bent remains so, and a
leaden ball does not rebound. While aeriform substances
are the most compressible of all, they are also the most
elastic. Air compressed returns to its usual condition
the moment that it is relieved from the pressure, and
with a force proportioned to the amount of the pressure.
So it is with steam and the gases. The varied results
of this quality of aeriform substances will claim our at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>tention
more particularly in some other parts of this
book.</p>

<p><a name="P_42" id="P_42"></a>
42. <b>Definition of Elasticity.</b>&mdash;You see from the illustrations
that have been given that elasticity is <em>that property
of matter by which its particles, when brought nearer
together or carried farther apart by any force, return to
their usual condition when the force is withdrawn</em>.</p>

<p><a name="P_43" id="P_43"></a>
43. <b>Usefulness of Variety in Properties of Matter.</b>&mdash;The
various properties of matter brought to view in this
chapter are providential adaptations to the necessities of
man. Each substance has those properties which best
fit it for his use. Iron, for example, designed by the
Creator to be both the strongest and most extensively
useful servant of man among the metals, is therefore provided
in great abundance, and has those strong, decided,
and various qualities which fit it for the services it is to
perform. Gold and silver, on the other hand, designed
for services less extensive, lighter, and in a great measure
ornamental, are provided in very much less quantity,
and have properties admirably adapting them to the
services for which they are so manifestly intended. The
same can be substantially said of all other substances,
and especially of those very abundant ones, air and water.
And it may be remarked also that the ingenuity of
man is continually discovering new modes of bringing
the various properties of matter into his service. I will
give but a single illustration&mdash;the tempering of steel.
"This discovery," says Dr. Arnot, "is perhaps second
in importance to few discoveries which man has made;
for it has given him all the edge-tools and cutting-instruments
by which he now moulds every other substance
to his wishes. A savage will work for twelve months
with fire and sharp stones to fell a great tree and to give
it the shape of a canoe, where a modern carpenter, with
his tools, could accomplish the object in a day or two."</p>

<span class="fs80">THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER.</span></h3>


<p><a name="P_44" id="P_44"></a>
44. <b>Extension.</b>&mdash;You can not conceive of any portion
of matter, however small it may be, that has not shape
or figure. It may be so small as to appear only as a
point to the naked eye, but seen through the microscope
its shape becomes obvious. Even an atom must have
length, breadth, and thickness, though it be so small that
we can not measure it, nor see its shape with the most
powerful microscopes. <em>Extension</em>, which is the term
commonly used to express this idea, is then an <em>essential</em>
property of matter; that is, it is a property of which no
form or kind of matter can be destitute. The distinction,
in this respect, between this property and those which I
have before noticed may be made obvious to you by an
example. Hardness is not an essential quality of matter,
for some kinds of matter are destitute of it; but no portion
of matter, hard or soft, can be destitute of extension
or shape. The air is sometimes spoken of in common
language as being shapeless. This is partly because it is
invisible, and partly because no portion or body of air
assumes any definite shape. But air is continually forced
into definite shapes by confinement in rooms, boxes, etc.;
and then its extension in different directions can be measured
as accurately as the extension of a solid can be.
And besides, the atoms of which air is composed are undoubtedly
solid, and we can not conceive of their existence
without attaching to them the idea of figure or extension.</p>

<p><a name="P_45" id="P_45"></a>
45. <b>Impenetrability.</b>&mdash;In common language one substance
is said to penetrate another. Thus a needle penetrates
cloth, a nail penetrates wood, etc. But this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
not strictly true. The needle does not go into the cloth,
but goes between the fibres of it, pushing them to the
one side and the other. So the nail goes between the
fibres of the wood, and not into them. It does not occupy
the same room that the fibres do at the same time.
So, also, no atom of matter can penetrate or go into any
other atom. It can only push it out of the way, and
then occupy its place. Impenetrability is therefore said
to be one of the essential qualities of matter. This means
simply that no portion of matter can occupy the same
space with another portion of matter at the same time.</p>

46. <b>Illustrations.</b>&mdash;Many illustrations might be given
of this property. I will give a few. If you press a tumbler
into water with its open end downward, you can
not fill it with water, for the air confined in the tumbler
prevents it from rising. It can not occupy the
same space with the air. It fills, indeed, a portion
of the tumbler, but this is because the air
is compressible. If you introduce a glass funnel,
<em>a</em>, Fig. 6, into a jar of water, <em>b</em>, with your
thumb on its mouth, <em>c</em>, the water will not rise
to fill it. But if you take your thumb off, the
water will rise to the level of the water outside
of the funnel, pushing up the air before
it. If you have not a funnel, a vial or bottle
with its bottom broken off will answer for
the experiment. The following is a very
pretty experiment, illustrating the same
point. Place a lighted taper, <em>a</em>, Fig. 7, on a
large flat cork in a jar of water. Put over
it an open jar or receiver, <em>b</em>, having a stop-cock,
<em>c</em>. Closing the stop-cock, press the receiver
down into the water, and you will see
the taper sink with it, as represented in the
figure, the air preventing the water from entering
the receiver. If now you open the
stop-cock the water rushes in, thrusting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
air upward, and making the taper to appear
as if rising out of the water. The
diving-bell offers a good illustration. It
consists of a vessel, <em>a a</em>, Fig. 8, shaped
like a bell, made sufficiently heavy to
sink in water. It is let down by a chain
and cable, as seen in the figure. The
water does not enter the bell any farther
than the compressibility of the air permits
it. In order that the men in it may
remain under water for some time fresh air is supplied
by the tube <em>b</em>, it being forced down by a forcing-pump.
At the same time the vitiated air can be let off by a valve
provided for that purpose. There are windows in the
top of the bell to give the requisite light for work on
the sea's bottom. Treasures are often recovered by this
means which would otherwise be lost. You see a resemblance
between the diving-bell and the arrangement in
Fig. 7, the receiver representing the bell and the lighted
taper the men in it.</p>

<p><a name="P_47" id="P_47"></a>
47. <b>Other Illustrations.</b>&mdash;If you drop a bullet into a
tumbler of water it pushes the particles to the one side
and the other, and occupies the room thus made. If
you drop in several there is a manifest rise of the water,
and you may drop in enough to make it overflow. The
same thing is true of the finest needle dropped in the
water&mdash;it does not penetrate it, but like the bullet displaces
some of its particles and occupies their room; and
you can make the water overflow by dropping in many
needles. We can truly say, then, that water can not be
penetrated even by a needle. When any substance, as
sugar, is dissolved in water, its particles do not penetrate
the water, but go into the spaces between its particles.
So, also, when particles from odorous substances are diffused
in the air, they are not really in the air, but are between
its particles.</p>

<p><a name="P_48" id="P_48"></a>
48. <b>Inertia.</b>&mdash;Matter has no power to put itself in mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>tion.
When it is moved it is moved by some force which
is either outside of the matter or is communicated to it
in some way. When your arm is moved it is not the
matter in your arm that is the cause of its motion. It
is caused by a force in you which I will not dwell upon
here, because the subject belongs to Physiology. When
air moves it is set in motion by some force acting upon
it, as when you blow it from your lungs or move it with
a fan. When the wind blows, the air is set in motion by
heat and the attraction of the earth, as will be explained
to you in another part of this book. I might multiply
examples to any extent, showing that matter of itself
can not move. This property of matter is termed <em>inertia</em>.</p>

<p><a name="P_49" id="P_49"></a>
49. <b>Inertia Shown in the Inability of Matter to Stop its
Motion.</b>&mdash;Matter, when once set in motion, has no power
to stop itself. If it could stop itself it could not be said
to be inert. And as it is inert, it would, when once set
in motion, keep on moving forever unless stopped by
some force. When a stone falls to the ground, it stops
simply because the earth stops it. If the earth were not
in the way, the stone would move straight on until it
were stopped by something else. So, also, a stone that is
thrown up in the air would keep on, and soon be out of
sight, and never return to the earth, if it were not made
to come down by forces acting upon it. One of these
forces is the resistance of the air, which, from the moment
the stone starts, is destroying its motion. Another
force as constantly operating to retard the stone is the
attraction, or drawing force, exerted by the earth upon
it. This powerful though unseen force will be treated
of fully in the next chapter.</p>

50. <b>Matter Equally Inclined to Rest and Motion.</b>&mdash;It
was formerly taught by philosophers that matter is more
inclined to rest than to motion; and this is the popular
notion now. This is because the chief causes that stop
the motions that we see from day to day&mdash;viz., the air
and the attraction of the earth&mdash;are not visible. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
this reason, until we investigate the subject, it seems to
us that motion has a natural tendency to stop, or is
<em>spent</em>, as it is expressed. When friction has an agency
in arresting motion we see it plainly; but the common
idea is, that in this case the motion is in part spent and
in part destroyed. But in no case is motion spent, but
it is always destroyed by obstacles. The more thoroughly
these are removed, the longer will the motion
continue; and if they were wholly removed, the motion
would never cease. Perpetual motion, then, is not in
itself impossible; for matter has no more tendency to
stop moving when once put in motion, than it has to begin
motion when it is at rest. All motion would be perpetual
if there were not forces opposing it. If there
were only one body in the universe, and that were set
in motion, it would move forever through empty space
in a straight line; for there is no matter any where to
resist its motion or to attract it away from its onward
course.</p>

<p><a name="P_51" id="P_51"></a>
51. <b>Divisibility.</b>&mdash;Though divisibility is a general quality
of matter (§ 18), it is not an <em>essential</em> one. For if it
be true that every portion of matter is composed of atoms
that remain whole (§ 14), this property can not be said
to belong to these atoms. It is only the bodies made up
of these atoms that can be divided. When we come to
the atoms themselves the division must stop.</p>

<p><a name="P_52" id="P_52"></a>
52. <b>Weight.</b>&mdash;In speaking of the properties of matter
I have said nothing about weight, although in the popular
mind this is thought of as being one of the most prominent
of the properties of some kinds of matter. This
will be appropriately treated of when I come to speak
of attraction, for it is a mere result of attraction. Suffice
it to state here, that the weight of a body is <em>the pressure
occasioned by the attraction existing between it and another
body</em>. If when a stone is raised from the ground
the attraction between it and the earth could be destroyed,
the stone would remain there. It would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
press down, and so would have no weight. It is plain,
therefore, that weight, so far from being an essential
property of matter, is not really a property at all. It is
only an effect of a property&mdash;attraction. If there were
only one body in the universe, it would have no weight,
for it would press in no direction because there is nothing
to attract it. But as it is, all matter has weight, for there
is other matter to attract it.</p>

<p><a name="P_53" id="P_53"></a>
53. <b>Nature of Attraction.</b>&mdash;If you attempt to break a
very tenacious solid substance, why do you not succeed?
It is because the particles are so strongly fastened together.
But how? By some kind of cement or glue, or
by some mechanical contrivances as nails or hooks? No.
They are fastened together by some unseen force. We
know nothing of the nature of this force. We know only
that it exists, and we call it attraction. The name is a
proper one, for it simply expresses the fact that one particle
attracts or draws another particle toward itself.</p>

<p><a name="P_54" id="P_54"></a>
54. <b>Newton's Idea of Attraction.</b>&mdash;It was stated in
§ 20 that the particles of matter, even in the densest substances,
are not in actual contact, but have spaces around
them. Now it was supposed by Newton that there is
some kind of ethereal substance pervading all these spaces,
which causes this attraction between the particles. He
supposed also that this ether was every where in space,
causing attraction between masses of matter. But all
this is mere supposition, and we know not whether there
is this sort of ethereal glue keeping the universe together,
or whether it is some property in the particles themselves
that makes them thus attract each other. But the fact
of the attraction we know, and we can observe the phe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>nomena
which it produces, and discover the laws or rules
by which this force is regulated in its action.</p>

<p><a name="P_55" id="P_55"></a>
55. <b>Attraction in Solids.</b>&mdash;Attraction is stronger in
some solids than in others. The mason with his trowel
easily divides a brick; but he can not do this with a
piece of granite, for its particles have a greater attraction
for each other than those of the brick. So a rap which
would break a glass dish would not injure a copper one
of the same thickness. A weight that would hang securely
from an iron wire would break a lead wire of the
same size; that is, it would tear the particles apart, because
they are not strongly attracted to each other. Attraction
has different modes of action in different solids.
It therefore fastens their particles together in different
ways, and thus produces all the various qualities, already
noticed, which are so useful to us&mdash;tenacity, hardness,
softness, ductility, flexibility, etc.</p>

<p><a name="P_56" id="P_56"></a>
56. <b>Attraction in Liquids.</b>&mdash;In a liquid the attraction
between the particles is very feeble compared with that
in solids. The attraction of the particles of steel is in
strength about three million times that of the particles
of water. We make the estimate in this way: We find
that a steel wire will sustain a weight equal to 39,000
feet of the wire. But a drop of water hanging to the
end of a stick can not be more than one-sixth of an inch
in length; that is, water will hold together by the attraction
of its particles only to this extent, which is a
little less than the three millionth part of the length of
steel wire which could hang without breaking.</p>

<p><a name="P_57" id="P_57"></a>
57. <b>Freeness of Movement of the Particles of Liquids.</b>&mdash;There
is one prominent characteristic of liquids which
is probably not entirely owing to the feeble attraction
of their particles&mdash;I mean the freeness with which these
particles are moved among each other. This is owing
probably in part to some peculiar arrangement of the
atoms in making the particles of a liquid. I will illustrate
this in a coarse way. If the atoms of lead in shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
were so arranged as to make irregular jagged forms, they
could not readily be moved among each other. We suppose
the ultimate atoms of a liquid to be so arranged in
the formation of particles as to make them not only round
but very smooth. Hence comes the great ease with
which they circulate among each other.</p>

<p><a name="P_58" id="P_58"></a>
58. <b>Globular Shape of Drops of Liquids.</b>&mdash;As the particles
of a liquid move thus freely among each other,
their attraction disposes them to assume a globular or
round shape. The reason of this can be made plain by
Figs. 9 and 10. The outside of a
perfect sphere is all at the same distance
from the centre. So all the
circumference of a circle is at the
same distance from the centre, as
represented in Fig. 9. But this is
not true of all parts of the surface
of a cube or of a square: <em>a</em>, for example,
is farther from the centre
than <em>b</em> is. Now in a drop of liquid all the particles are
attracted toward the centre, for in that line from each
particle lies the largest number of particles to attract it.
This can be made obvious by taking
some point in the drop, as represented
in Fig. 10, and drawing
lines from it through the centre
and in other directions. If <em>a</em> be
the point in the drop, it is plain
that the line from it through the
centre is longer than <em>a b</em> or <em>a c</em>.
Therefore a particle, <em>a</em>, will be attracted
toward the centre rather than in the direction <em>a b</em>
or <em>a c</em>, because there are more particles in the direction of
the centre, and the more particles there are the stronger
is the attraction. But this is not all. The particles in
the line <em>a c</em>, tending to make <em>a</em> go toward <em>c</em>, are balanced
by the particles in the line <em>a e</em>, tending to make it go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>ward
<em>e</em>. The two lines of particles therefore together
tend to make it go in a middle line between them, that
is, toward the centre, just as two strings pulling equally,
the one to <em>c</em> and the other to <em>e</em>, would make a body, <em>a</em>,
move in a middle line between these two directions.
The same can be shown of the two lines of particles <em>a b</em>
and <em>a d</em>, and so of any other two alike in situation on each
side of the line through the centre. The tendency of
every particle is, then, to go toward the centre, and it
would go there if there were not particles between to
prevent it. You see how this would operate in the case
of the particles on the surface of the drop. As these are
all striving, as we may say, in obedience to attraction, to
get to the centre, none of them will be raised up into an
angle or a point, as would be the case if the drop were
in the shape of a cube. If this should be done it would
show that some of the particles were not as strongly attracted
toward the centre as others are, which is an impossibility.</p>

<p><a name="P_59" id="P_59"></a>
59. <b>The Globular Form in Different Liquids.</b>&mdash;The disposition
to form a sphere is seen more distinctly in mercury
than in any other liquid. If you drop a little of it
upon a plate it separates into globules, which roll about
like shot. Why can not the same thing be done with
water? Why do the drops of water hang upon the window-pane,
showing only in an imperfect way their disposition
to the globular arrangement? It is because the
particles of water have a greater attraction for other
substances, and less attraction for each other, than the
particles of the quicksilver have. Water sometimes exhibits
its disposition to the globular form in full on the
leaves of some plants, and rolls about in balls like mercury.
This is because there is something on the surface
of the leaf which repels rather than attracts the water.
If you put your finger, however, on one of these drops,
it will spoil it, and your finger will be moistened, because
there is an attraction between the particles of your skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and of the water. Take another illustration of this difference
in attraction. If you drop a little oil upon the
surface of water it will float about in round drops. This
is because the water repels the oil, as the surface of some
kinds of leaves does water. But when oil is spilled upon
wood or cloth its particles have so strong an attraction
for their particles that they unite with them, instead of
gathering up into little round companies as they do on
the surface of water.</p>

<p><a name="P_60" id="P_60"></a>
60. <b>Manufacture of Shot.</b>&mdash;We have a beautiful example
of the tendency of fluids to the globular arrangement
in the manufacture of shot. The melted lead is poured
into a large vessel in the top of the shot-tower. This
vessel has holes in its bottom, from which the metal falls
in drops. Each drop, as it whirls round and round in
its fall, takes the globular form. By the time that it
reaches the end of its journey, about two hundred feet,
it becomes so far cooled as to be solid, and as it is received
in a reservoir of water, its globular form is retained.
Bullets can not be made in this way, because a
quantity of melted lead sufficient to make a bullet will
not hold together in a globular form.</p>

<p><a name="P_61" id="P_61"></a>
61. <b>Globular Form of the Earth and the Heavenly
Bodies.</b>&mdash;It is supposed that the sun, moon, earth, and
all the heavenly bodies were once in a liquid state, and
that they owe their globular shape to this fact. As they
whirled on in this condition in their course, the different
solids were gradually formed, and at length they acquired
their present state. How all the mighty changes could
be effected in our earth, converging it from a liquid into
a body with a solid crust, having such various substances
in it, and so variously arranged, with its depressions containing
water, and the whole covered with its robe of air
fifty miles in thickness, we can not understand. And yet
there are some portions of the process which chemistry
and geology have revealed to us, giving us some glimpses
of the wonders which, during the lapse of ages, God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wrought in our earth in preparing it for the habitation
of man.</p>

62. <b>Crystallization.</b>&mdash;The arrangement of the particles
of solid substances is different from that of liquids. The
tendency here is to straight lines and angles; that is, to
crystalline forms. Alum or common salt, when it becomes
solid from a solution, forms crystals. So also does
sugar. The crystals of
different substances are
different. In Fig. 11 you
have the crystal of common
salt, and in Fig. 12
that of alum. We see this
crystalline tendency every
where, even in the rude rocks and common stones. The
rocks are disposed to exhibit regular layers, or columns,
or battlements, and always do so except when interfering
circumstances prevent. And when you examine their
composition, or that of the stone under your feet, you
see the same crystalline disposition in detail that you
see in the mass.</p>

<p><a name="P_63" id="P_63"></a>
63. <b>Crystallization of Water.</b>&mdash;Water, when it changes
into a solid, shows the same disposition, of which the
crystals of the snow and the frost-work on our windows
are familiar examples. When snow forms, the water of
the clouds is suddenly crystallized by the cold air, the
particles taking their regular places more readily and
certainly than if they were guided by intelligence, because
in obedience to an unerring law established by the
Creator. We sometimes have an example of this sudden
crystallization of water under our eye. The water in a
pitcher may remain fluid, although it is cooled down to
the freezing point, and even below it, if it be kept perfectly
still. But on taking up the pitcher the water at
once becomes filled with a net-work of ice-crystals. The
explanation is this: The stillness of the water has prevented
its particles from taking on the new arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
needed for the formation of ice; but the jostling of them
in taking up the pitcher has served to make them do it
thus suddenly.</p>

64. <b>Frost and Snow.</b>&mdash;The frost-work on our windows
is a wonderful exhibition of the variety of forms that
crystallization can produce. It sometimes presents figures
like leaves and flowers, such as we see chased on vessels
of silver, but much more delicate and beautiful. So
varied and fantastic are the forms in which these water-crystals
are arranged, that it is very natural to ascribe
them, as is done universally in the dialect of the nursery,
to the ingenuity of a strange and tricksy spirit. Every
snow-flake is a bundle of little crystals as regular and
beautiful as the crystals which you so much admire in a
mineralogical cabinet. And there is great variety in the
grouping of these crystals. You have some specimens
of these groups in Fig. 13 as they appear on examining
them with the microscope. Over six hundred different
forms have been enumerated, and a hundred have been
delineated. It is a very quick operation by which the
particles of water in the clouds thus marshal themselves,
as if by magic, in these regular forms. But a quicker
operation is that by which hail is formed&mdash;so quick that
the particles have not time to set themselves in the crys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>talline
arrangement, but are huddled together without
order. The brilliant and glistening whiteness of the
snow is owing to the reflection of light from its minute
crystals. In the arctic regions the beauty of the snow
is often much greater than with us. "The snow crystals
of last night," says Captain M'Clintock in his "Discovery
of the Fate of Sir John Franklin," "were extremely beautiful.
The largest kind is an inch in length; its form
exactly resembles the end of a pointed feather. Stellar
crystals two-tenths of an inch in diameter have also fallen;
these have six points, and are the most exquisite
things when seen under a microscope. In the sun, or
even in moonlight, all these crystals glisten most brilliantly;
and as our masts and rigging are abundantly
covered with them, the <em>Fox</em> never was so gorgeously
arrayed as she now appears."</p>

<p><a name="P_65" id="P_65"></a>
65. <b>Order in Nature.</b>&mdash;We see in this general tendency
to crystallization a striking illustration of the fact that
God is a God of order. Disorderly arrangement is never
seen except where there is an obvious necessity for it.
And even when there is apparent disorder, a little examination
generally shows that essentially there is order.
The rocks that give so much variety to scenery are not
piled up in confusion, and order has evidently reigned
in their construction. Pick up a common stone, and on
breaking it you will see the crystalline arrangement in
its interior. Nay, more, much of the very soil is made
up of separated and broken crystals.</p>

66. <b>Particles Must be very Near to Each Other to Adhere.</b>&mdash;Why
is it that when you have broken any thing made
of glass, however accurately you may bring the two parts
together, you can not make them unite in one again? It
is simply because the particles of substances will not attract
each other enough to be united unless they are
brought very near together. Now it is impossible to
bring the particles on the two surfaces of a broken piece
of glass as near together as they were before it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
broken. If you could do so, no crack would be visible.
You can join them by some kind of cement. This is because
the particles of the cement, while it is soft, can be
insinuated among the particles of the glass; and thus,
when it dries, it becomes a bond of union between the
particles on each side of the breach. For the same reason
you can make the cut surfaces of some yielding substances
adhere. If you divide a piece of India-rubber
with a clean cut, you can make the two surfaces adhere
by pressing them together firmly. The particles in this
case are not unyielding, as those of the glass are, and
some of them are therefore brought into such near neighborhood
as to attract each other sufficiently to unite together.
So, too, if you cut two bullets so as to have a
very smooth flat surface on each, you can make them adhere
quite strongly by pressing them together, especially
if you give a little turning motion at the same time that
you press, for this will cause the particles on the two
surfaces to be somewhat mingled together. If you have
quite large balls of lead with
handles, as represented in
Fig. 14, it will require considerable
force to separate
them when they have been thus pressed together.</p>

<p><a name="P_67" id="P_67"></a>
67. <b>Other Illustrations.</b>&mdash;Silver and gold may be made
to adhere to iron by a very great and sudden pressure.
The iron must be made very smooth, and the silver or
gold plate very thin. A powerful blow brings the particles
of the thin plate into such nearness to those of the
iron that union is effected, or, in other words, that they
attract each other sufficiently to be united. So, also, a
sheet of tin and one of lead can be made to adhere so as
to form one sheet by the pressure of the rollers of a flatting-mill.
Two very smooth panes of glass laid one upon
another may have so many particles brought into great
nearness as to occasion some adhesion. It will be slight,
however, few comparatively of all the particles coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
near enough to adhere, for the smoothest glass is full of
inequalities, as may be seen by the microscope.</p>

<p><a name="P_68" id="P_68"></a>
68. <b>Strength of Adhesion.</b>&mdash;In no case do particles
come in actual contact (§ 20), and their adhesion depends
on the nearness of their neighborhood to each other.
The strength of union, then, between two surfaces depends
on the number of particles brought near enough
to adhere together. In the case of the two bullets or
the lead balls, if all the particles of the two surfaces were
near enough to adhere, the lead would be just as strong
at the junction as any where else. The reason that so
strong adhesion takes place between portions of some
substances when we soften them by heat is that the particles
of the two softened ends are all brought near
enough together for adhesion. Thus the two ends of a
broken stick of sealing-wax may be firmly united by heating
them and then pressing them together. The same
thing can be done with glass. When iron is welded, as
it is termed, some hammering is required to make the
particles of the two softened ends of the iron unite.</p>

69. <b>Attraction Between Solids and Liquids.</b>&mdash;The attraction
which solids and liquids have for each other furnishes
us with many interesting phenomena. The adhesion
of drops of water to glass and other solids is a
familiar example of this attraction. If you dip your hand
into water, it is wet on taking it out, because your skin
has sufficient attraction for the water to retain some of
it. A towel will retain more of it for two reasons&mdash;with
the interstices between its fibres it presents much more
surface to the water, and it
has none of the oily substance
which on your skin, though
being in small quantity, serves
somewhat to repel the water.
The attraction of solids and
fluids for each other is shown
very prettily in the experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>ment
represented in Fig. 15 (p. 47). A piece of wood is
attached by the string, <em>a</em>, to one end of a balance, and
weights just sufficient to balance it are placed in the opposite
scale. If now the wood is brought in contact
with the water in the vessel, <em>b</em>, it will require additional
weight in the scale to separate the wood from the water.</p>

70. <b>Farther Illustrations.</b>&mdash;When you see stems of
plants rising above the surface of stagnant water you
will observe that the water is considerably raised about
them. This is from the attraction between them and the
water. For the same reason water is not as high in the
middle of a tumbler as it is at the sides. If you immerse
a piece of glass in water, the water will rise at its sides
as represented in Fig. 16. If you immerse two together,
as in Fig. 17, the water will rise higher between than
outside of them, because the particles between are attracted
by two surfaces, while those outside are attracted
only by one. It is for the same reason that two men can
raise a weight higher than one
of them can alone. And if
the pieces of glass be brought
quite near together, as in Fig.
18, the water will be raised
higher still, because there is
less to be raised by the two
surfaces. It is just as two
men can raise a small weight
higher than they can a large one. The same thing may
be beautifully illustrated in this way: Let two pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
glass, as represented in Fig. 19, be
immersed in colored water, with two
of their edges joined together at
A B, the opposite edges at E D C
being separated. The height to
which the fluid rises will make a
curved line, A F C, it being lowest
at the edges which are separated, and highest at the
edges which are joined together.</p>

71. <b>Rise of Liquids in Tubes.</b>&mdash;For the same reason
that water rises higher between plates of glass than outside,
so it will rise higher in a
tube than it will outside of it.
The diagram in Fig. 20 will
make this clear. I represent in
this a transverse section of a
tube, enlarged so that the demonstration
may be plain. We
will take a particle on the inside
and the outside at equal distances
from the glass. It is
clear that the particle <em>a</em> is not as near to as many particles
of the glass as the particle <em>b</em> is. The lines drawn
show this. The longest lines extending from the particles
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> to the glass are equal in length; that is,
<em>a e</em> and <em>a f</em> are equal to <em>b g</em> and <em>b h</em>. It is clear, therefore,
that all the glass between the lines at <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> is as
near to the particle <em>b</em> as the glass between the lines at e
and <em>f</em> is to the particle <em>a</em>. But this is not all. The particle
<em>b</em> is near enough to all the inside of the tube to be
attracted by it, while very little attraction is exerted
upon <em>a</em> by any part of the glass beyond that which is
included between <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>. The same difference can be
shown with regard to all the particles on the inside of
the tube compared with those outside. The former are
nearer to more particles of the glass than the latter, and
therefore are more strongly attracted. Again, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
nearer the plates of glass are (§ 70) the higher the water
rises between them, so the smaller the tube is the higher
will the water rise in it. You can
try the experiment as represented
in Fig. 21. It is obvious that the
particle <em>b</em> (Fig. 20) would not be
very strongly attracted by the part
of the tube opposite if the tube
were a large one; but it would be
if the tube were very small, for then it would be quite
near to that part.</p>

72. <b>Capillary Attraction.</b>&mdash;The term capillary (derived
from the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capilla</i>, hair) has been commonly
applied to the attraction exhibited under the circumstances
just noticed, because it is most obvious and was
first observed in tubes of very fine bore. The same term
is used when the attraction is seen in the rising or spreading
of a liquid in interstices as well as in tubes. Thus
capillary attraction causes the rising of oil or burning
fluid in the wicks of lamps. The liquid goes up in the
interstices or spaces between the fibres, as it does in the
spaces of tubes. I will give some other examples. If
you let one end of a towel be in a bowl of water, the
other end lying over upon the table, the whole towel
will become wet from the spreading of the water among
the fibres in obedience to capillary attraction. If you
suspend a piece of sponge so that it merely touch the
surface of some water, or if you lay it in a plate with
water in it, the whole sponge will become wet. So, too,
if you dip the end of a lump of sugar in your tea, and
hold it there a little time, the whole will be moistened.
In very damp weather the wood-work in our houses
swells from the spreading of water in the pores of the
wood in obedience to capillary attraction. Especially
will this be so in basement rooms, where the water can
go up from the ground in the pores of the walls, as well
as from the damp air. In watering plants in pots, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
water be poured into the saucers, it will pass up through
the earth by capillary attraction. For the same reason
plants and trees near streams grow luxuriantly, being
abundantly supplied with water, which rises to their
roots through the pores of the soil. The disposition of
wood to imbibe moisture in its pores has sometimes been
made use of very effectually in getting out millstones.
First a large block of stone is hewn into a cylindrical
shape. Then grooves are cut into it all around where a
separation is desired, and wooden wedges are driven
tightly into them. These absorb moisture from the
dews and rain, and therefore swell so much as to split
the stone in the direction of the grooves. The blotter
which you use furnishes an illustration of capillary attraction,
the ink being taken up among the fibres of the
paper. Ordinary writing paper will not answer as a
blotter, because the sizing fills up the interstices between
the fibres.</p>

<p><a name="P_73" id="P_73"></a>
73. <b>Attraction Between Masses.</b>&mdash;I have thus far
treated of attraction as existing between the atoms or
particles of matter when they are brought very near together,
which is called the attraction of <em>cohesion</em>. But
it exists also between any portions of matter that are
separate from each other. Thus if two cork balls be
placed on the surface of water near to each other, their
attraction will soon bring them together. To have the
experiment striking, the balls must be varnished, that
they may glide easily over the water. Bubbles of glass
will exhibit the same attraction. So, also, floating pieces
of wood are apt to be found together; and when a ship
is wrecked, as soon as the sea becomes calm the parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the wreck are in collections here and there. Now when
a stone falls to the ground, it does so for precisely the
same reason that the two cork balls come together in the
water. The idea of all who have not been informed on
such subjects is, that the stone comes to the ground because
the ground is down and the stone is up, and there
is nothing to support the stone in the air. They have
no idea that some power makes the stone come down.
There is such a power, and it is the attraction which the
earth and the stone have for each other. If you hold the
stone in your hand, and thus prevent its falling, you simply
resist a power which is pulling it down. If you could
in any way suspend the attraction of the earth and the
stone for each other, you could let go of the stone, and it
would remain just there in the air, and would not come
down until the attraction is restored.</p>

<p><a name="P_74" id="P_74"></a>
74. <b>Attraction Mutual.</b>&mdash;The cork balls move toward
each other because their attraction is mutual. So do the
earth and stone really move toward each other for the
same reason. As the stone is drawn toward the earth,
so is the earth drawn toward the stone. But the earth
is so large a thing to be drawn that its motion is exceedingly
small&mdash;so small that practically it may be considered
as nothing.</p>

<p><a name="P_75" id="P_75"></a>
75. <b>Illustration.</b>&mdash;This may be clearly illustrated if we
compare the force of attraction to the force of muscular
action. Suppose a man in a boat pulls on a rope which
is made fast to a ship lying loose at the wharf, and in
this way draws his boat toward it. He does not dream
that he moves the ship at all; but he in reality does, for
if instead of one boat a hundred or more pull upon the
ship, they will move it so much as to make the motion
apparent. In the case of the single boat, the ship as
really moves as when a hundred boats are pulling on it,
but it is only the one hundredth part as much. Now let
the ship represent the earth, and the little boat some
body, as a stone, attracted by it. The earth and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
stone move toward each other, just as the ship and the
boat do. And if, as we multiplied the number of boats,
we should multiply the bulk of the stone till it is of an
immense size, it would have by its attraction a perceptible
influence upon the earth's motion.</p>

<p>Observe in regard to the illustration, that it makes no
difference whether the man be in the boat or in the ship
as he pulls. In either case he exerts an equal force on
the ship and the boat, making them to approach each
other. So it is with the attraction between the earth
and the stone. It is a force exerted equally upon both.
Its effect on the earth is not manifest, because it is so
much larger than the stone; just as the effect of the
man's pulling is not manifest upon the ship, because it
is so much larger than the boat.</p>

<p><a name="P_76" id="P_76"></a>
76. <b>Proportion of the Mutual Motions of Attraction.</b>&mdash;Let
us pursue the illustration a little farther. If a man
stand in a boat, and pull a rope made fast to another
boat of the same size and weight, both boats, in coming
together, will move over the same space. Just so it is
with the attraction between two bodies having the same
quantities of matter or equal weights&mdash;they attract each
other equally, and therefore meet each other half way.
Let now one boat be ten times as great and as heavy as
the other. The small boat would move ten times as
much as the large one when the man brings them together
by pulling the rope. In like manner, if a body
one-tenth as large as the earth should approach it, they
would attract each other, but in coming together the
body would move ten times as far as the earth would.
In the case of falling bodies, even though they may be
of great size, the earth moves so slightly to meet them
that its motion is wholly imperceptible. It has been
calculated that if a ball of earth the tenth part of a mile
in diameter were placed at the distance of a tenth part
of a mile from the earth, as the earth and this body would
be moved by their attraction to meet each other, the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>tion
of the earth would be only the eighty thousandth
of a millionth (
<span class="blkb">
    <span class="blka">1</span>
    <span class="blka over">80,000,000,000</span>
</span>
) of an inch.</p>

<p><a name="P_77" id="P_77"></a>
77. <b>Attraction Universal.</b>&mdash;The attraction of which I
have been speaking exists between all bodies, however
distant they may be from each other. Sun, earth, moon,
and stars attract each other; and in obedience to this
attraction they have a tendency to come together in one
great mass, and would do so if another force acting in
opposition to this did not prevent it. This force will be
treated of in another part of this book.</p>

<p><a name="P_78" id="P_78"></a>
78. <b>The Tides.</b>&mdash;One effect of the attraction between
the earth and the moon is quite familiar. I refer to the
tides. When the tide rises it is because the water of the
ocean feels the attracting force of the moon. The moon
actually lifts the water toward itself. The attraction of
the sun sometimes increases and sometimes diminishes
the tides, according to its position in relation to the
moon and the earth. If the land were as movable as
the water, or, in other words, if its particles were held
together by no stronger attraction than those of water,
there would be the same motion that there is in the
ocean over the surface of the earth, as in its revolution
successive portions of it present themselves toward the
moon.</p>

<p><a name="P_79" id="P_79"></a>
79. <b>Meaning of the Word Gravitation.</b>&mdash;The attraction
thus existing between different bodies of matter separated
from each other is called the attraction of gravitation
or gravity, in distinction from the attraction of <em>cohesion</em>
treated of in the previous chapter. This name
was given to it because we have such common examples
of its influence in the fall of bodies to the earth. They
are said to <em>gravitate</em> toward the earth. And they are
said to do so by the force or attraction of gravitation or
gravity. The term <em>terrestrial</em> gravitation is sometimes
used in speaking of the earth's attraction, in distinction
from the same thing in operation in other planets.</p>

80. <b>Attraction Toward the Earth's Centre.</b>&mdash;All bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
are attracted toward the centre
of the earth. This is because the
earth is globular, as may be made
clear by Fig. 22. Let the circle
represent the earth, and <em>a</em> a body
attracted by it. The lines drawn
from the body to the earth represent
the attractive force exerted
by the earth upon the body.
It is obvious from these that there
is as much attraction on the one
side of the line drawn from the
body to the earth's centre as there
is on the other. The attractive
force, then, of the earth as a whole is exerted upon the
body in the direction of this middle line. It tends to
draw it, therefore, toward the centre. If, therefore, a
weight be suspended by a string, the line of the string
continued would go to the centre of the earth. This
being so, it is clear that two weights suspended by
two strings do not hang perfectly parallel to each other.
The difference is so slight in an ordinary pair of
scales that it can not in any way
be perceived. But if it were possible
to suspend in the heavens a
beam so long as to stretch over a
large extent of the earth's circumference,
as represented in Fig. 23,
the scales attached to it would be
very far from hanging parallel to
each other. Substances suspended
in different parts of the globe are
hanging in different directions, and
those which are hung up by our fellow-men
on the opposite side of the
earth, are hanging directly toward us.</p>

81. <b>Up and Down.</b>&mdash;All falling bodies fall toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
centre of the earth, and the same remarks can be made
on this point that I have made in relation to suspended
weights. Up and down are merely relative terms&mdash;<em>up</em>
being from the centre of the earth, and <em>down</em> toward it.
As the earth moves round
on its axis, the same line of
direction which we call upward
at one time is downward
at another. This may
be illustrated on Fig. 24.
Let the circle represent the
circumference of the earth.
In the daily revolution we
pass over this whole circle.
If we are at D at noon, we
are at E at six o'clock, and
at F at midnight. If, therefore,
the ball A be dropped
from some height at noon,
the line in which it falls will be at right angles to a line
in which it will fall if you drop it from the same height
at six o'clock; for this height will have moved in this
time from A to B. If it be dropped from the same
height at midnight its line of direction will be directly
opposite to what it was twelve hours before; for the
height will have moved in that time to C.</p>

<p>It is not always true that falling bodies tend exactly
toward the centre of the earth. It is nothing in the centre
that attracts them, but it is the substance of the whole
earth; and as this is irregular in its density and form,
the attraction will be irregular also. Thus it is found by
accurate experimenting that a plumb line suspended in
the neighborhood of a mountain is so attracted by it that
it will not hang exactly parallel with another suspended
at some distance from the mountain. The difference is
not, however, enough in any case to have any practical
bearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="P_82" id="P_82"></a>
82. <b>Weight.</b>&mdash;I have said before (§ 52) that what we
call weight is not a property of matter, but merely the
result of a property, the attraction of gravity. This I
will now illustrate. If two bodies are falling to the earth,
and one of them contains ten times as many particles of
matter as the other, ten times as much force of gravity
is required, and is actually exerted, to bring it to the
ground. This will appear plain to you if you bear in
mind that a body does not come to the ground because
there is nothing to keep it there, but because it is drawn
down by the force of attraction, and then compare this
force to any other force, as, for example, that of muscular
action. If you draw toward you two weights, one of
which is twenty times as heavy as the other, or, in other
words, has twenty times the quantity of matter that the
other has, you must exert twenty times as much strength
on the former as you do on the latter. Just so it is with
the force of attraction. The earth attracts or draws toward
itself a body having twenty times the quantity of
matter that another has with twenty times the amount
of force. And the first body will have twenty times the
weight of the other, for it will make twenty times the
pressure upon any thing that resists the force with which
the earth draws it toward itself. Weight, then, is <em>the
amount of the pressure occasioned by the attraction existing
between the earth and the body weighed</em>. If you
place a substance in one side of a pair of scales, it goes
down because of the attraction between it and the earth.
By placing weights in the other side until the scales are
balanced, you find how much is needed to counteract the
downward pressure caused by the attraction of the substance
and the earth for each other; or, in other words,
you find out how much it weighs. In doing this you
use certain standard weights; that is, certain quantities
of matter which have been agreed upon by mankind, and
are called by certain names, as pounds, ounces, etc. When
a spring is used in weighing, the spring has been tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
by these standard weights, and its scale has been marked
accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="P_83" id="P_83"></a>
83. <b>Weight not Fixed, but Variable.</b>&mdash;Weight does not
depend alone upon the density of the body weighed, but
also upon the density of the earth. For the attraction
causing the pressure which we call weight is a <em>mutual</em>
attraction, and is in proportion to the quantities of matter
in both the body and the earth. If, therefore, the density
of the earth were increased twice, three times, or four
times, the weights of all bodies would be increased in the
same proportion; that is, the force with which the earth
would attract them would be twice, three times, or four
times as great as now. This would not be perceived by
any effect on balances, for the weights and the articles
weighed would be alike increased in weight. But it
would be perceived in instruments that indicate the
weights of bodies by their influence on a spring. These
would disagree with scales and steelyards just in proportion
to the increase of the earth's density. It would be
perceived also in the application of muscular and other
forces in raising and sustaining weights. Every stone
would require twice, three times, or four times the muscular
effort to raise it that it does now.</p>

<p><a name="P_84" id="P_84"></a>
84. <b>Weight Varies with Distance.</b>&mdash;The nearer two
bodies are to each other the greater is their attraction.
The nearer a body is to the earth the greater is the attraction
that presses it toward the earth; in other words,
the greater is its weight. The force of gravity, or weight,
is greatest, therefore, just at the surface of the earth,
and it diminishes as we go up from the earth. As we
go from the earth, the force of gravity lessens in such a
proportion that it is always <em>inversely</em> as the square of the
distance from the centre of the earth. I will explain.
If the distance from the centre of the earth to its surface,
which is 4000 miles, be called 1, then 4000 miles from
the earth would be called 2, or twice as far from the centre,
and 8000 miles from the earth would be 3, and so on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
The squares of these numbers would be 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.
Now as weight lessens so as to be <em>inversely</em> as the square
of the distance, a body weighing a pound on the surface
of the earth would weigh but a quarter of a pound at
the distance of 4000 miles, and but the ninth part of a
pound at 8000 miles. A body weighs less on the summit
of a high mountain than it would in the valley below,
because it is farther away from the great bulk of
the earth, and therefore is not so strongly attracted.
The difference, however, is but small. A man weighing
two hundred and fifty pounds in the valley would weigh
but half a pound less if on the summit of a mountain
four miles high.</p>

<p><a name="P_85" id="P_85"></a>
85. <b>Weight Every Where.</b>&mdash;I have spoken of weight
only in relation to the earth. But there is weight in
bodies every where, for there is attraction wherever there
is matter. The weight of substances on the surface of
different heavenly bodies varies according to the quantities
of matter in those bodies. As the moon is much
smaller than the earth, what weighs a pound with us
would weigh much less than a pound in the moon. And
as the sun is much larger than the earth, what is a pound
with us would be much more than a pound there. If we
knew the exact densities of the sun and the moon and
the earth, as well as their size, we could estimate exactly
the difference in the weights which any body would have
in them; for the attraction which causes the pressure
that we call weight is as the quantity of matter, and the
quantity of matter depends on both density and size.</p>

<p><a name="P_86" id="P_86"></a>
86. <b>Cohesion, Capillary Attraction, and Gravitation the
Same.</b>&mdash;The attraction of cohesion, capillary attraction,
and gravitation are only different modes of action of the
same power; viz., the attraction which matter every
where has for matter. At first thought it would appear
that there is something peculiar in the attraction of particles
when they are brought together so as to adhere.
For if we take any substance, a piece of glass, for exam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>ple,
its particles seem to be held together by an attraction
vastly stronger than that attraction which inclines
different bodies to move toward each other. If you break
the glass, however closely you may press the two pieces
together, they will not unite again. It would seem, at
first view, that there must be some peculiar arrangement
of the particles which is destroyed by breaking the glass.
But we can readily account for the facts in another way.
The attraction between bodies of matter is the greater
the nearer we bring them together. The nearer, for example,
is the moon to any portion of the earth, the greater
is the attraction which it exerts, as seen in the tides;
and if it were much nearer to the earth than it is, our
tides would prove awfully destructive. What is true of
masses is also true of the particles of which they are composed.
Though their attraction is comparatively feeble
when at a distance from each other, it increases, not in
the arithmetical but the geometrical ratio (§ 84), as they
come nearer together; so that when they are exceedingly
near together the attraction is very powerful. It must
be remembered in regard to the pieces of broken glass
that you can not bring the particles on their surfaces as
near as they were before the glass was broken, for the
crack does not disappear. And as the attraction is inversely
as the square of the distance, a little distance
must make a great difference. The particles of some
substances you can bring so near together as to cause
adhesion, as you saw in the case of the two bullets (§ 66).
That their adhering together depends merely upon their
particles being brought near to each other appears from
the fact, that the smoother you make the surfaces the
more strongly will they adhere. And the reason that
liquids and semi-liquids adhere so readily to solid substances
is, that their particles, moving freely among each
other, have thus the power of arranging themselves very
near to the particles of the solid. Thus, when a drop of
water hangs to glass, all the particles of water in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
part of the drop next to the glass touch, or rather are
exceedingly near to, the particles of the glass.</p>

<p><a name="P_87" id="P_87"></a>
87. <b>Variety in the Results of Attraction.</b>&mdash;It is one and
the same force, then, which binds the particles of a pebble
together, and makes it fall to the ground&mdash;which
"moulds the tear" and "bids it trickle from its source"&mdash;which
gives the earth and all the heavenly bodies their
globular shape, and, in connection with another power
hereafter to be noticed, makes them revolve in their orbits.
How sublime the thought that this one simple principle
that gives form to a drop extends its influence
through the immensity of space, and so marshals "the
host of heaven" that, without the least interruption or
discord, they all hold on their course from year to year
and from age to age! It is thus that Omnipotence makes
the simplest means to produce the grandest and most
multiform results.</p>

<p><a name="P_88" id="P_88"></a>
88. <b>Opposition Between the Modes of Attraction.</b>&mdash;Although
cohesion and gravitation are essentially the same
thing, we see them continually acting in opposition to
each other. Abundant illustrations might be given, but,
I will cite only a few.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p><a name="P_89" id="P_89"></a>
89. <b>Why Pitchers have Lips.</b>&mdash;If you pour water out
of a tumbler there is a struggle between the attraction
of cohesion and gravitation for the mastery&mdash;the attraction
of cohesion tending to make the water adhere to
the tumbler, and run
down its side, as
in Fig. 25, and
gravitation tending
to make it fall
straight down.
But when water
is poured out of a
pitcher, as in Fig.
26, the lip of the pitcher acts in favor of the attraction
of gravity; for the water would have to turn a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sharp corner to run down the outside of the pitcher in
obedience to the attraction of cohesion. In pouring water
from a tumbler, we can often, by a quick movement,
throw the water, as we may say, into the hands of gravity
before the attraction of cohesion can get a chance to
turn it down the tumbler's side. If you can only make
the water <em>begin</em> to run from the tumbler without going
down its side there will be no difficulty; for there is an
attraction of cohesion between the particles of the water,
tending to make them keep together, which in this case
acts against the cohesion between the water and the
glass, and therefore acts in favor of gravitation. It is
cohesion that forms the drop on the lip of a vial as we
drop medicine&mdash;cohesion between the particles of the
liquid, and cohesion between these particles and those
of the glass. It is gravitation, on the other hand, that
makes the drop fall, it becoming so large that the force
of gravity overcomes the cohesion between the drop and
the vial.</p>

<p><a name="P_90" id="P_90"></a>
90. <b>Size Limited by Gravity.</b>&mdash;Were it not for the attraction
of gravity there would be no limit to the size of
drops of any liquid. When the drop reaches a certain
size, it falls because it is so heavy; or, in other words,
because with its slight cohesion the attraction of the
earth brings it down. Now if this attraction could be
suspended, and the attraction of cohesion left to act
alone, particles of water might be added to the drop to
any extent, and they would cling there. You can see
the struggling between cohesion and gravitation very
prettily illustrated if you watch the drops of rain on a
window-pane. If two drops happen to be quite near together
they unite by attraction, and then, being too large
to allow of its being retained there by cohesion in opposition
to gravitation, the united drop runs down. If it
meet with no other drop it soon stops, because by cohesion
some portion of it clings to the glass all along its
track, and so at length lessens it sufficiently to allow it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to remain suspended again. It is from the influence of
the attraction of gravitation that different kinds of liquids
furnish drops of different sizes, the heavier giving small,
and the lighter large ones. Thus you can drop from a
vial a larger drop of alcohol than of water, and a larger
one of water than of nitric acid. You have another illustration
of a similar character in the adhesion of chalk to
a black-board or any surface. The chalk crayon itself
can not adhere, for the attraction of the earth does not
permit it. But small quantities of it can adhere for the
same reason that water adheres to surfaces in small quantities.
So also dust clings to sides of furniture, though
a lump of dirt would not.</p>

91. <b>Illustrated in Solid Bodies.</b>&mdash;We can illustrate the
limitation of size in solid masses
by Figs. 27 and 28. Suppose
that <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, Fig. 27, are
two projections of timber from
a post, <em>b</em> being twice as large
as <em>a</em>. It is evident that <em>b</em> can
not support twice as much
weight as <em>a</em>, for gravitation is
dragging it downward from
its attachment to the upright
post with twice the force that
it does <em>a</em>. The case is still
stronger when, as represented in Fig. 28 (p. 64), the
larger timber is twice as long as the smaller. Here <em>d</em>
has four times the bulk of <em>c</em>. But it can not support
four times as much weight at its end, not only because
its own weight presses it downward, but because half of
its weight is at a greater distance from the place of attachment
than the smaller beam is. Gravitation here
operates in opposition to cohesion in such a way that the
projecting timber, if carried to a certain size, will fall by
its own weight, either breaking in two, or tearing away
from its attachment. This tendency is very commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
resisted in buildings and other structures by braces, as
represented in Fig. 29. Here the weight of the horizontal
timber at some
distance on each side
of <em>a</em>, is made to press
upon the upright post
instead of directly
downward.</p>

92. <b>Farther Illustrations.</b>&mdash;The
size of bodies, both animate
and inanimate,
is limited by the Creator
in obedience to
the principles above
developed. This is
seen in the fact that
there are no animals
on the land to compare
in size with the
monsters of the deep. A whale does very well in the
water, because he is buoyed up by that element; but an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
animal as large as a whale could not well exist on land,
because gravitation would act so strongly in opposition
to cohesion. At least it would be necessary, in order
that he might walk about, or even hold together, that
his great bulk should be made up of very firm and tenacious
materials. Whenever any thing very large or tall
is to be supported, its support is always broad and composed
of very cohesive materials. We see this exemplified
in the massive trunks of full-grown trees, as compared
with the slender trunks of trees of the same kinds in the
nursery. We see it exemplified in the fact that the highest
mountains are built of the hardest rocks, while the
soft chalk formations are confined to those of small size.
There is a limit to the height even of the granite mountains
in the influence of gravity. If carried much higher
than they are, the attraction of the earth, in its opposition
to cohesion, would tear them apart in their fissures, or
cause the immense weight to crush their foundations.
In the moon, where gravitation is less than on the earth
(§ 85), mountains can be much higher without these results,
and accordingly the telescope shows them to be so.
In Jupiter, on the other hand, which is much larger than
the earth, the mountains, if there be any, can not rise to
any great height, and if there be any living beings as
large as we are in that planet they must be made of vastly
firmer materials to prevent their being crushed by
their own weight.</p>

<p><a name="P_93" id="P_93"></a>
93. <b>The Above Principles Transgressed by Man.</b>&mdash;Man
often transgresses these principles in his structures. For
example, a building settles because the foundation is not
strong enough to bear the superincumbent weight; in
other words, the force of gravitation is not sufficiently
taken into the account. When a very tall building is
erected, the lower portions ought to be made of very cohesive
substances. Firm granite is therefore an appropriate
material for the lower story of tall brick buildings.
At least should the walls of the lower stories of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
buildings be made thicker than they ordinarily are, to
resist properly the force of gravitation in the weight
above. Stores intended to bear much weight on their
floors are often built without due regard to the cohesive
force required to sustain the weight. Long timbers are
sometimes supported only at the ends, when their own
weight, to say nothing of what may be brought to press
upon them, requires that they should be supported at
other points. While in modern buildings the timbers
are often too small, in some old buildings the upper timbers
are so heavy as to lessen rather than increase the
strength of the structure. Especially is this true of the
unsightly beams which in some ancient houses we see
extending along the ceilings above. Many other examples
could be given, but these will suffice.</p>

<p>The practiced eye, in looking at a building, instinctively
requires that every part should be <em>seen</em> to be suitably
supported. A gallery in a church, therefore, if
without pillars or braces from the wall, is displeasing to
such an eye, even though there may be really sufficient
support provided in the mode of structure. The same
can be said of galleries supported by slender iron pillars,
especially if they be painted of some light color so as to
look as if they were wood rather than iron. For the
same reason porticoes without pillars are unsightly. So,
too, the eye instinctively looks for a sufficient base to every
pillar and pilaster. The concealment of the base in
any way, or the substitution of any thing else for it, is
an unpleasant anomaly, and yet such anomalies are sometimes
seen even in expensive buildings.</p>

94. <b>Attraction of Natural Philosophy and of Chemistry.</b>&mdash;The
attraction of which I have treated in this and the
previous chapters is that which belongs to Natural Philosophy,
in distinction from that of Chemistry. Its effects
are only mechanical, while the attraction of Chemistry
goes beyond this, and affects the <em>composition</em> of
substances. For example, the attraction between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, which makes them
unite to form water, belongs to Chemistry; while that
which makes the particles of water cohere is in the province
of Natural Philosophy.</p>

95. <b>Centre of Gravity Illustrated.</b>&mdash;If you balance a
ruler on your finger, as in
Fig. 30, it is balanced because
there is just as much
weight on one side as on
the other. Now just over
your finger, in the middle
of the ruler, there is a point
that we call the centre of
gravity; or, in other words,
the centre of the weight of
the ruler. This point is indicated
in the figure. There
is as much of the weight
of the ruler on the one side
of this point as on the other, and also as much above it
as below it. If your finger should be a little to the one
side or the other of this point, the ruler would not be
balanced, and would fall. When balanced it does not
fall, simply because this central point is supported by being
directly over the end of the finger. The weight of
the ruler, then, may be considered practically as all being
in that point, for it is there that is exerted all the downward
pressure of the ruler as it is balanced. So, also,
when the ruler is balanced on the finger, as represented
in Fig. 31 (p. 68), this same centre of gravity is directly
over the point of the finger, and is therefore supported.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
If it be to the one side or the
other, as in Fig. 32, it is not
supported, and the ruler therefore
falls. You see, then, that
if a body be balanced, the centre
of gravity is directly <em>over</em>
the point of support. If, on
the other hand, a body is suspended,
the centre of gravity
is directly <em>under</em> the point of
support.</p>

96. <b>Definition.</b>&mdash;If a plumb-line
from the centre of gravity
could be extended into the
earth it would go directly to
its centre. The body may be
considered as making all its
pressure from its centre of
gravity in that direction, in
obedience to the attraction of
gravitation. The best definition,
then, that we can give of
the centre of gravity is, that it is <em>that point in a body
from which its pressure as a whole toward the centre of
the earth proceeds</em>. It is that point, therefore, the support
of which insures the support of the whole body.
And in speaking of the weight of a body, or its downward
pressure, we may consider all the matter composing
it as collected or concentrated in that point. The body,
therefore, can be balanced in any position in which this
point is supported, as shown in Figs. 30 and 31. And
when a body is suspended, it is at rest only when the
centre of gravity is directly under the
point of support. Thus, if you have a
circular plate suspended at E, Fig. 33, it
will not be at rest when it is moved to
the one side or the other, as represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
by the dotted lines, but only when the centre of gravity,
<em>c</em>, is directly under the point E.</p>

97. <b>How to Find the Centre of Gravity of a Body.</b>&mdash;If
you take a piece of board, and suspend it at A, Fig. 34,
and suspend a plumb-line from the same point, the centre
must be somewhere in that line. But exactly at what
point it is you do not know. How will you ascertain
this? Mark the line A B on the board, and suspend the
board by another point, as in Fig. 35. As the centre of
gravity must be somewhere in the plumb-line as it now
hangs, of course it is at O, where the two lines cross.</p>

98. <b>Scales and Steelyards.</b>&mdash;When two bodies are connected
by a rod or bar, the centre of gravity of the whole
is somewhere in the connection. If the two bodies be
equal in weight, as in Fig. 36, the centre of gravity is
exactly in the middle of the rod, as marked. But if the
bodies are unequal, as in Fig. 37, the centre of gravity
is nearer to the larger body than to the smaller. In balancing
a body in one scale with weights in another, you
have a case parallel to that of Fig. 36. The centre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
gravity of the body weighed, the weights, and the scales,
as a whole, is midway between the scales, at the point
of support. In the steelyard you have the heavy body
to be weighed nearer the centre of gravity than the small
weight is on the long arm, and so the case is parallel
with that of Fig. 37.</p>

99. <b>The Centre of Gravity of a Body not Always in the
Body Itself.</b>&mdash;The centre of gravity of a hollow ball of
uniform thickness is not in the substance of the ball, but
it is in the centre of the space in the ball, for the line
of the ball's downward pressure
would be from that point. If the
ball had a frame-work in it, as
represented in Fig. 38, the centre
of gravity would obviously be at
A, the centre of this frame-work.
But if there were no frame-work,
and perpendicular lines were supposed
to be drawn from different
points of suspension, C, B, D, and E, these would intersect
at the point A, showing that this is the centre of
gravity, according to the rule for finding it given in § 97.
So, also, the centre of gravity of an empty box, or an
empty ship, would be an imaginary point in the space
inside. In a hoop it is the centre of the hoop's circle.</p>

100. <b>The Centre of Gravity Seeks the Lowest Point.</b>&mdash;The
centre of gravity always takes the lowest place which
the support of the body will allow. In a suspended body,
therefore, it is always directly under the
point of suspension. To get to the one
side or the other of this position it must
rise. This the attraction of gravity forbids,
and if by any force it is made to
rise, this attraction at once brings it
back. This is manifest in the case of a
suspended ball, Fig. 39. If the ball be
moved to <em>b</em>, it will, on being let go, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>turn
to its first position, simply because its centre of
gravity, in obedience to the earth's attraction, seeks the
lowest place possible. From inertia (§ 49) it moves beyond
this point, and continues to vibrate back and forth
for some time; but when its motion is stopped, it hangs
perpendicularly; that is, in such a way that its centre of
gravity shall have the lowest possible position. I add a
few other illustrations of the same point. When a rocking-horse
is at rest, its centre of gravity is directly over
the point at which it touches the floor, for thus it has its
lowest possible place. If it be rocked, the centre of
gravity is moved to a higher point, and for this reason
it rocks back again. The same is seen in the swing, the
cradle, the rocking-chair, etc. Most interesting illustrations
of the same thing are found in the Laggan, or Loggan
Stones as they are called, several of which are seen
on the rugged parts of the British coast. An immense
rock, which has been loosened by some convulsion, rests
with a slightly-rounded base on another rock which is
flat, and it is so nicely balanced that one person alone
can produce a perceptible rocking motion in it. I saw,
many years ago, a large rock near Salem, Massachusetts,
thus situated. There is one also in Great Barrington,
Massachusetts.</p>

101. <b>Farther Illustrations.</b>&mdash;It is because the centre of
gravity always seeks the lowest place that an egg lies
upon its side. When on its side, the centre of gravity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
at its lowest point, as is manifest from comparing Fig. 40
with Fig. 41 (p. 71). Children often have a toy, called a
witch, which illustrates the same thing in another way.
It is a piece of light substance, as pith, with a shot fastened
in one end. It always
stands up on its loaded end, and
can not be made to lie down on
its side, because the centre of
gravity would not then be at
the lowest point. There is an
amusing Chinese toy of the same
kind. It is a figure of a fat old
woman, Fig. 42, loaded with lead
at the bottom, so that its centre
of gravity is at <em>a</em>. If the figure be thrust over to one
side, as shown by the dotted lines,
the centre of gravity is raised, and
the upright position is at once resumed.
If the toy were not loaded,
it would lie in the position
represented in Fig. 43, just as the
egg lies on its side.</p>

102. <b>Curious Experiments.</b>&mdash;You can not hang a pail
of water on a stick laid upon a table, as represented in
Fig. 44, for the centre of gravity is not supported. But
if you place another stick
a as a brace, in the manner
represented in Fig.
45 (p. 73), so as to push
the pail under the table,
it will hang securely, because
the centre of gravity
is now under the
point of suspension. The
explanation of the following
experiment is the
same: Run a large nee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>dle
through a cork; fasten to the cork a fork, and you
can suspend the whole on the edge of a table, as seen in
Fig. 46. Here the centre of gravity is directly under
the point of suspension, which is at the point of the needle.
The same can be said of
the very common toy represented
in Fig. 47. The horse,
made of very light material,
stands securely, because the
centre of gravity of the whole
is in the heavy ball, which is
under the point of suspension.
If the horse be made to rock
back and forth, the centre of
gravity in the ball moves in a
curved line, as in the case of a ball suspended by a string
(Fig. 39). It is at its lowest place only when the horse
is at rest. The hanging of a cane with a hook-shaped
handle on the edge of a table is to be explained in the
same way.</p>

103. <b>Stability of Bodies.</b>&mdash;The firmness with which
a body stands depends upon two circumstances&mdash;the
height of its centre of gravity, and the extent of its
base. The lower the centre of gravity, and the broader
the base, the firmer does the body stand. A cube, rep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>resented
in Fig. 48, is more stable, that is, less easily
turned over, than a body shaped as Fig. 49, because it
has a larger base. The contrast is still greater between
Figs. 48 and 50. The reason of the stability of a body
with a broad base is found in the fact, that in turning it
over the centre of gravity must be raised more than in
turning over one of a narrower base. The curved lines
indicate the paths of the centres of gravity as the bodies
are turned over. In the case of a perfectly round ball,
the base is a mere
point, and therefore
the least touch turns
it over. Its centre of
gravity does not rise
at all, but moves in
a horizontal line, as
shown in Fig. 51. The
pyramid is the firmest
structure in the world, because it
possesses in the highest degree
the two elements&mdash;a broad base,
and a low position of the centre
of gravity. On both these accounts
the centre of gravity must
ascend considerably when the
body is turned over, as seen in
Fig. 52.</p>

104. <b>Bodies not Upright Unstable.</b>&mdash;When a body does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
not stand upright, its stability is
diminished simply because only a
portion of the base is concerned
in its support. In Fig. 53 the
base is broad, but the body is so
far from being upright that the
centre of gravity bears upon the
very extremity of the base on one
side, as the perpendicular line
from it indicates. The least jostle will turn it over, because
the centre of gravity need not ascend the least
when this is done. You see, then, that the less upright
a body is, the less of the base is of service in its support,
because the farther is the line of direction of the downward
pressure of the
centre of gravity from
the centre of the base.
The famous tower of
Pisa, Fig. 54, one hundred
and thirty feet
high, overhangs its
base fifteen feet. It
was undoubtedly built
intentionally in this
way to excite wonder
and surprise, for what
would otherwise have
been a very unsafe
structure is rendered
stable and safe by the
arrangement of its
materials. Its lower
portion is built of very dense rock, the middle of brick,
and the upper of a very light porous stone. In this way
the centre of gravity of the whole structure is made to
have a very low position.</p>

105. <b>Familiar Illustrations.</b>&mdash;You see now the expla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>nation
of the fact which common experience teaches every
one, that the taller is a body, and the narrower its
base, the more easily is it
overturned. This is exemplified
in the two loads, Fig.
55. The base is the space
included by the wheels.
The centre of gravity is so
high in the tall load that
a perpendicular line drawn
from it falls outside of the
base if the cart come upon a considerable lateral inclination
of the road. But the smaller load, under the same
circumstances, is perfectly secure from overturning. A
high carriage is more easily overturned than a low one,
for the same reason. A stage, if loaded on its top, is very
unsafe on a rough road. Stability is given to articles of
furniture by making their bases broad and heavy, as you
see in tables supported by a central pillar, candlesticks,
lamps, etc. The tall chairs in which children sit at table
would be very insecure if their legs were not widely separated
at the bottom, thus widening the base of support.
In the ladder, so commonly used now in picking fruit, a
broad base is furnished between the foot of the ladder
and the two standards which are spread out to sustain
its top.</p>

106. <b>Support of the Centre of Gravity in Animals.</b>&mdash;The
base of support which quadrupeds have, viz., the
space included between their four feet, is quite large;
and this is one reason that they walk so soon after birth.
A child does well that can walk at the end of ten or
twelve months, for the supporting base is quite small
compared with that of a quadruped. It consists of the
feet and the space between them. It requires skill, therefore,
in the child to manage the centre of gravity in standing
and walking, and this is gradually acquired. If one
should grow up without ever standing on his feet, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
would find, as the infant does, that some training is necessary
to enable him to do it. It is on account of the
smallness of the base furnished by the feet that the statue
of a man is always made with a large base or pedestal.
Although we exert considerable skill in walking, by
no means so much is requisite as the Chinese ladies must
put in exercise with their small feet. Still more skill is
exercised by one who has two wooden legs, or one who
walks on stilts. The base made by the feet can be varied
much by their position. If the toes be turned out and
the heels brought near to each other, the base will not
be as large as when the feet are
straight forward and far apart, as
is manifest in Figs. 56 and 57. It
is for this reason that the child, in
his first essays at standing and walking, instinctively
manages his feet as in Fig. 56.</p>

107. <b>Motions of the Centre of Gravity in Walking.</b>&mdash;In
walking, the centre of gravity is alternately brought over
one foot and the other, and so moves in a waving line.
This is very manifest as you see people before you going
down the aisle out of a church. When two are walking
together, if they keep step the two waving lines of their
centres of gravity run parallel, as in Fig. 58, and they
walk easily; but if they do not keep step these lines run
as in Fig. 59, and the movement is both awkward and
embarrassing. The line of movement of the centre of
gravity is always slightly waving <em>upward</em> also, as seen
in Fig. 60 (p. 78). In the case of a man with wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
legs the line would not be gently waving, but somewhat
angular, as represented in Fig. 61.</p>

108. <b>The Centre of Gravity and Attitudes.</b>&mdash;The
object of various attitudes
assumed under different circumstances
is to keep the centre of gravity
over the base of support. A man with
a load on his back would not assume
the position of Fig. 63, but that of Fig. 62, so that the
centre of gravity of his load
may be directly over his
feet. So a man carrying
any thing in front leans
backward, as in Fig. 64.
In ascending a hill a man
appears to lean forward, and
in descending to lean backward;
but in fact he is in
both cases upright in reference
to the plain on which
the hill stands, as may be
seen in Fig. 65. A perpendicular
line drawn from his
centre of gravity strikes the
ground midway between the
feet, that is, in the middle of
the base, and if prolonged would
go straight to the centre of the
earth. When one rises from a
chair he draws his feet backward,
and then bends his body forward
to bring the centre of gravity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
over the feet. Unless this is done, it is impossible to
rise, at least deliberately, as you will find by trying the
experiment. A man standing with his heels close to a
wall can not stoop forward and pick up any thing, for
the wall prevents him from moving any part of his body
backward, and therefore when he stoops forward, the
centre of gravity being brought far in advance of the
base, he loses his balance and falls. A man who did
not understand this undertook to stoop in this way to
pick up a purse containing twenty guineas, which he was
to have if he succeeded, the forfeiture in case of failure
being ten guineas. Of course his centre of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'gravity made made him'">gravity
made him</ins> lose his wager.</p>

<p><a name="P_109" id="P_109"></a>
109. <b>Rope-Dancers, Tops, etc.</b>&mdash;Great skill is exhibited
by the rope-dancer in supporting the centre of gravity.
Similar skill is seen in feats of balancing, as, for example,
in balancing a long stick upright on the finger. In these
cases the centre of gravity is very little of the time directly
over the point of support. It is kept in constant
motion nearly but not quite over this point, this unstable
equilibrium, as it is called, being vastly less difficult to
maintain than stable equilibrium; that is, keeping the
balance in one unvarying position. It is the motion of
the top that makes it to stand upright upon its point&mdash;a
very beautiful example of unstable equilibrium. The centre
of gravity revolves around a perpendicular line, at
exceedingly little distance from it at first, but greater
and greater as its motion becomes less rapid, till at length
the centre of gravity gets so far from this line that the
top falls. For a similar reason an intoxicated man may
not be able to keep himself up if he undertake to stand
still, and yet may do so if he keep moving. As in the
case of the top, his centre of gravity must be kept in
motion, or he must fall.</p>

<span class="fs80">HYDROSTATICS.</span></h3>


<p><a name="P_110" id="P_110"></a>
110. <b>What Hydrostatics Teaches.</b>&mdash;Hydrostatics is that
branch of Natural Philosophy which treats of the pressure
and equilibrium of liquids. The phenomena which
it brings to view all results <em>from the influence of the attraction
of the earth upon liquids</em>. It is for this reason that
this subject calls naturally for our consideration after examining
the general subject of attraction, as we have
done in the previous chapters. In order to understand
fully the phenomena of Hydrostatics, you must continually
bear in mind the two grand characteristics of liquids.
One is, that the particles move freely among each other
(§ 9). The other is, that a liquid is almost entirely incompressible
(§ 36).</p>

<p><a name="P_111" id="P_111"></a>
111. <b>Level Surface of Liquids.</b>&mdash;It is the influence of
gravitation upon liquids that gives them a level surface
whenever they are not agitated by any cause. Observe
how this is. A still body of water you may consider as
being made up of layers of particles. Each layer will
have all its particles equally attracted by the earth, and
must therefore be level. If any of the particles were less
attracted than their neighbors they would rise, as is the
case when heat is applied, as you will see hereafter.
Whenever the upper layers of the particles are disturbed
by wind or any other cause, as soon as the disturbance
ceases the particles will again take their places in level
layers under the influence of gravitation.</p>

<p><a name="P_112" id="P_112"></a>
112. <b>A Comparison.</b>&mdash;The particles of water may be
compared to shot. If you have shot in a vessel, and they
are heaped up in any portion of the surface, on shaking
the vessel those that are highest will roll down, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
result will be a level surface. They would do this without
agitation if they were as smooth as the particles of
water are. If we could have a microscope strong enough
to distinguish the shape of the particles of water, the
surface would probably appear like the level surface of
shot in a vessel. But the particles of water are so exceedingly
minute that the surface of water, when entirely
free from agitation, is so smooth as to constitute a perfect
mirror, often feasting our eyes with another world
of beauty as we look down into its quiet depths. Water
was man's first mirror, and one of the most beautiful
passages in the "Paradise Lost" is the description of
Eve's first waking after her creation at the side of a lake,
and seeing her form reflected in its smooth waters.</p>

<p><a name="P_113" id="P_113"></a>
113. <b>Surface of Liquids not Truly Level.</b>&mdash;Strictly
speaking, the surface of a liquid is not level, but rounding.
But it is so little so that it can not be perceived
unless we take into view a very large surface, as the
ocean. Here it is very manifest, for whenever a ship
comes into port the first thing seen from the shore is the
topmost sail, the rest of the ship being concealed by the
water rounded up between it and the observer. This is
illustrated in Fig. 66. At <em>a</em> the ship is just in sight,
while at <em>b</em> it is so near shore that the eye sees the whole
of it. If the earth had no elevations of land, or if there
was water enough to cover them, the water would make
a perfectly globular covering for the earth, being held to
it by the force of attraction. The reason for this is precisely
the same as was given in § 58 for the disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of a drop of liquid to take the globular form. As in that
case, so in this, it can be demonstrated that each particle
is attracted toward a common centre, and that this
will produce in the freely-moving particles a uniformly
rounded surface. What could thus be shown to be true
if the earth were wholly covered with water, is true of
the portions of water which now fill up the depressions
in the earth's crust; and it can be perceived, as shown
in the first part of this paragraph, in the case of any extended
portion of it.</p>

<p><a name="P_114" id="P_114"></a>
114. <b>Spirit-Level.</b>&mdash;What we call a perfectly level surface
is, then, one all parts of which are equally distant
from the centre of the earth, and is therefore really a
spherical surface. But the sphere is so large that any
very small portion of it may be considered for all practical
purposes a perfect plane. A hoop surrounding the
earth would bend eight inches in every mile. In cutting
a canal, therefore, there is a variation in this proportion
from a straight level line. As the variation is but an
inch in an eighth of a mile, it is of no account in taking
the level for buildings. Levels are ascertained by what
is called a spirit-level. This
consists of a closed glass tube,
Fig 67, nearly filled with alcohol.
The space not occupied by alcohol is occupied by
air. The tube is placed in a wooden box for convenience
and security, there being an opening in the box at <em>a</em>.
Now when the box with its glass tube is perfectly level,
the bubble of air will be seen in the middle at <em>a</em>; but if
one end be higher than the other, the bubble will be at
or toward that end.</p>

<p><a name="P_115" id="P_115"></a>
115. <b>Rivers.</b>&mdash;If a trough be exactly level, the water
will be of the same depth at one end as at the other, for
the surface of the water at both ends will be at the same
distance from the centre of the earth. But raise up one
end, and it is now deepest at the other end. If it were
not so, the surface at the two ends would not be at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
same distance from the centre of the earth. Now if,
with the trough thus placed, water run in at the upper
end and out at the lower, you have exemplified what is
taking place in all rivers&mdash;the water is in constant motion
from the influence of gravitation, causing it to seek to be
on a level. A very slight slope will give the running
motion to water, for the particles are so movable among
each other that in obedience to gravity they flow down
the inclined plane to seek a level. Three inches declivity
in every mile in a smooth straight channel will make a
river run at the rate of about three miles an hour. The
Ganges, which receives its waters from the Himalaya
Mountains, in running 1800 miles falls 800 feet. The
Magdalena, in South America, falls only 500 feet in running
1000 miles between two ridges of the Andes.</p>

<p><a name="P_116" id="P_116"></a>
116. <b>How some Rivers have been Made.</b>&mdash;Changes are
constantly produced in the earth by the disposition of
water to seek a level. In doing this the water carries
solid substances of various kinds from elevated places
into depressed ones, tending to fill up the latter. New
channels are also sometimes made by the water. The
boy who makes a little pond with his mud-dam, and lets
the water overflow from it into another pond on a lower
level, as he sees a channel worked by the water between
the two ponds becoming larger and larger, witnesses a
fair representation on a small scale of some extensive
changes which have in ages past taken place in some
parts of the earth. It is supposed, and with good reason,
that many rivers had their origin in the way above
indicated. For example, where the Danube runs its long
course there was once a chain of lakes. These becoming
connected together by their overflow, the channels cut
between them by the water continually became larger,
until at length there was one long, deep, and broad channel,
the river, while the lakes became dry, and constituted
the fertile valley through which that noble river
runs to empty into the Black Sea. It is said that a sim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>ilar
process is manifestly going on in the Lake of Geneva,
the outlet of it becoming continually broader, while the
washing from the neighboring hills and mountains is filling
up the lake. Towns that a century ago lay directly
upon the borders of the lake have gardens and fields now
between them and the shore; and Dr. Arnot says, "If
the town of Geneva last long enough, its inhabitants will
have to speak of the river in the neighboring valley, instead
of the picturesque lake which now fills it."</p>

117. <b>Canals.</b>&mdash;The management of the locks of a canal
is in conformity with the disposition of water to seek a
level. A ground view of a lock and a part of two adjacent
locks is given in Fig. 68. The lock, C, has two pair
of flood-gates, D D and E E. The water in A is higher
than in C, but the level is the same in C and B, because
the gates, E E, are open. Suppose now that there is a
boat in the lock B that you wish to get into the lock A.
It must be floated into the lock C, and the gates E E
must be closed. The water may now be made to flow
from the higher level, A, into C, till the level is the same
in both A and C. But this can not be done by opening
the gates D D, for the pressure of such a height of water
in the lock A would make it difficult, perhaps impossible,
to do this; and besides, if it could be done, the rapid
rush of water into C would flood the boat lying there.
The discharge is therefore effected by openings in the
lower part of the gates D D. These openings are covered
by sliding shutters, which are raised by racks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pinions, as represented in Fig. 69. When the water has
become of the same level in A and C, the gates DD can
be easily opened, and the boat may be floated from C
into A. If a boat is to pass downward in the locks, the
process described must be reversed.</p>

<p>Canals are also extensively used for supplying water
by side openings to turn water-wheels for the working
of machinery. The water turns the wheel by the force
which gravitation gives it as it descends from the level
of the canal to the level of the river.</p>

<p><a name="P_118" id="P_118"></a>
118. <b>Other Illustrations.</b>&mdash;We see the tendency of
fluids to be on the same level in other ways. In a coffee-pot
the liquid has the same level in the spout as in the
vessel itself, whatever may be its position, as seen in Fig.
70 (p. 86). If it be turned up so far that the level of the
fluid in the vessel is higher than the outlet of the spout,
the fluid runs out. If two reservoirs of water be connected
together the water will stand at the same height
in both, whatever the distance between them may be.
So, also, in the aqueduct pipes that extend from a reservoir,
the water will rise as high as the surface of the wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>ter
in the reservoir itself. If
the outlets of the pipes be lower
than this level the water will
run from them, as in the case
of the coffee. The cause of
these and similar facts is the
same as that of the level surface
in vessels and reservoirs&mdash;the
action of gravitation. This may
be made plain by Fig. 71. Let
the figure represent a vessel
with divisions of different degrees
of thickness, these divisions,
however, not extending
to the bottom of the vessel.
Water in this would stand at
the same level in the different
apartments, just as it would if
the vessel had no such divisions,
as represented. This is
simply because the attraction
of the earth acts upon the water
in the same way with the
divisions as without them. And
you can see that it will make
no difference whether these divisions
be thick or thin, or
whether the apartments be
near, as you see here, or far
apart, as they are when
branch pipes extend from a
reservoir. A branch pipe
may be considered as having
the same relation to the reservoir,
as one of the narrow
apartments in the figure has
to the rest of the vessel. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
result is not at all affected by either the size or form of
the tubes that may be connected with a common reservoir&mdash;a
fluid will stand at the
same height in all.</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus we
have, in Fig. 72, tubes of various
size and shape, <em>a b c d e</em>,
connected with a reservoir, <em>r</em>,
and if water be poured into
one of them it will rise to the
same height in all, just as in the different apartments of
the vessel represented in Fig. 71. A man once thought
that he had gained the great desideratum,
perpetual motion, by a vessel
constructed as in Fig. 73. He reasoned
in this way: If the vessel contain
a pound of water, and the tube
only an ounce, as an ounce can not
balance a pound, the water in the
vessel must be constantly forcing
that in the tube upward. It therefore must constantly
run out of the outlet of the tube, and as it flows into the
vessel the circulation must go on, and the only hindrance
to its being a perpetual circulation would be the evaporation
of the water. He was confounded when he found,
on pouring water into the vessel, that it stood at precisely
the same level in the vessel and the tube.</p>

119. <b>Aqueducts.</b>&mdash;The ancients built aqueducts of stone
at immense expense, in some cases spanning valleys at
great heights, to supply their cities with water. At the
present day the same object is effected at comparatively
small expense with iron pipes laid under ground. No
matter how much lower than the reservoir a valley crossed
by the pipes may be, the water flowing through them
will rise any where in their branches to the same height
as it stands in the reservoir. It is supposed by some
that the ancients were not aware of this fact; but by
others that they were aware of it, and built their im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>mense
aqueducts because they had no material for constructing
large pipes.</p>

120. <b>Springs and Artesian Wells.</b>&mdash;The principles
which I have developed in the previous paragraphs will
explain the phenomena of springs, common wells, and
Artesian wells. The crust of the earth is largely made
up of layers of different materials, as clay, sand, gravel,
chalk, etc. When these were formed they were undoubtedly
horizontal, but they have been thrown up by convulsions
of nature in such a way that they present every
variety of arrangement. As some of these layers are
much more pervious to water than others, the rain which
falls and sinks into the ground often makes its way
through one layer lying between two others which are
impervious to water, and so may make its appearance at
a great distance from the place of its entrance, and at a
very different height. How this explains the phenomena
of springs, common
wells, and Artesian
wells may be made
clear by Fig. 74. A
A and B B B are designed
to represent
porous layers of
earth lying between
other layers which
are impervious to
water. The water
in A A will flow out at C, making what is commonly
called a spring. If we dig a well at F, going down to
the porous layer, B B B, the water will rise to G, because
this is on a level with the surface of the ground, H, where
the supply of water enters. From this point it may be
raised by a pump. If the well be dug at D, the water
will rise not only to the surface but to E, because this is
on a level with H. Water is sometimes obtained under
such circumstances from very great depths. In this case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the porous stratum containing the water is reached by
boring, and then we have what is termed an Artesian
well. The name comes from Artois, in France, where
this operation was first executed. There is a celebrated
well of this sort in Paris over 1800 feet deep, and the
water rises 112 feet above the surface. More than 600
gallons are discharged every minute. "London," says
Dr. Arnot, "stands in a hollow, of which the first or innermost
layer is a basin of clay, placed over chalk, and
on boring through the clay (sometimes of 300 feet in
thickness) the water issues, and in many places rises considerably
above the surface of the ground, showing that
there is a higher source or level somewhere&mdash;probably
among the Surry hills or those north of London."</p>

<p><a name="P_121" id="P_121"></a>
121. <b>Pressure of Liquids in Proportion to Depth.</b>&mdash;The
pressure of a fluid is in exact proportion to its depth.
For, as the particles are all under the influence of gravity,
the upper layer of them must be supported by the
second, and these two layers together by the third, and
every layer must bear the weight of all the layers above
it. The increase of pressure at great depths produces
the most striking effects. Thus if an empty corked bottle
be let down very deep at sea, either the cork will be
driven in or the bottle will be crushed in. A gentleman
tried the following experiment: He made a pine-wood
cork, so shaped that it projected over the mouth all
around. He then covered this with pitch, and fastened
over the whole several pieces of tarpaulin. The bottle,
thus prepared, he let down to a great depth by attaching
to it a weight. On raising it up he found that it contained
about half a pint of water strongly impregnated
with pitch, showing that the pressure of the water forced
water through the several pieces of tarpaulin, the pitch,
and the pores of the wooden cork. When a ship founders
near land, the pieces of the wreck, as it breaks up,
float to the shore; but when the accident happens in
deep water, the great pressure forces water into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pores of the wood, and thus makes it so heavy that no
part of the vessel will ever rise again. When a man
dives very deep he suffers much from the pressure on his
chest. If we watch a bubble of air rising in water it is
small at first, but it grows larger as it approaches the
surface, because it sustains less pressure than when it
was deep in the water. The force with which a fluid is
discharged from an opening in a vessel depends on the
height of the fluid above the opening. The difference in
this respect between a full barrel and one nearly empty
is very obvious. Most fishes, probably, can not bear the
pressure of great depths, and so are commonly found on
the coast, or on banks, as they are called, in the midst
of the ocean.</p>

122. <b>Sluice-Gates, Dams, etc.</b>&mdash;The application of the
above principles in the construction of sluice-gates, dams,
etc., is a matter of great practical importance. Let us
look at this. As pressure in a fluid is always in proportion
to the height of the fluid above the point of pressure,
the pressure upon any portion of the side of a vessel containing
a fluid must be in proportion to its distance from
the surface; or, in other words, it is the weight of a column
of water extending from
this portion to the surface.
Let A B C D (Fig. 75) represent
a <em>section</em> of a cubical
vessel, that is, one in which
each side is of the same size
with the bottom. The pressure
on the point <em>a</em>, in the line
A B, is that of a column of
particles, A <em>a</em>. But A <em>a</em> is
equal to <em>c b</em>, and <em>c b</em> is equal
to <em>b a</em>. Therefore <em>b a</em> may represent the pressure on <em>a</em>.
In the same way it can be shown that <em>e d</em> represents the
pressure on <em>d</em>, <em>n m</em> the pressure on <em>m</em>, C B that on B.
Therefore the pressure on all the points in A B will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
represented by lines filling up all the triangular space
A B C, and this is half of A B C D, which represents the
pressure on the line C B. It is clear, then, that as the
pressure on a vertical line in the side is half that on a line
at right angles to it in the bottom, the pressure on the
whole side is half that on the whole bottom.</p>

<p>We see from the above demonstration why it is that a
dam is built in the form represented
in Fig. 76. We see, also, why in the
monstrous vats in some of the English
breweries (some of them holding many
thousand barrels) the hoops and other
securities at the lower part of them
require to be made of very great
strength. It is manifest, also, that if a sluice-gate is to
be kept shut by a single support, this must be applied at
one third of the distance from the bottom, there being
as much pressure, as seen by Fig. 75, on the lower third
as on the upper two thirds of the gate.</p>

123. <b>Lateral Pressure in Fluids.</b>&mdash;The pressure of a
liquid on the side of a vessel, of which I have spoken
above, is a <em>lateral</em> pressure, and it is caused by the downward
pressure of gravitation in the liquid. But how?
The particles of a fluid are freely movable among each
other, and therefore are ready to escape from pressure in
any direction. The particles at <em>a</em>, Fig. 75, pressed upon
by the column of particles extending above them to the
surface, are ready to escape laterally, and would do so
if there were an opening made in the vessel at that point.
But if the vessel contained a block of ice, fitting it as accurately
as the body of water, there would be no escape
at the opening, because the particles of the solid are so
held together that the downward pressure of the earth's
attraction occasions no lateral pressure.</p>

<div class="caption">
Fig. 78.</div>
</div>

<p>The manner in which the downward pressure of the
earth's attraction causes lateral pressure may be made
clear by Figs. 77 and 78. We will suppose that the par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>ticles
of solids and liquids are alike round,
and that a solid differs from a liquid only
in having its particles firmly united by
attraction. Let <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>, in Fig. 77,
represent three particles of a solid. As
they are united firmly they will have a
united pressure from the centre of gravity
directly toward the centre of the
earth, as represented by the arrow. Let now <em>d</em>, <em>e</em>, and
<em>f</em>, Fig. 78, represent three particles of
water. These being but very slightly
coherent, will make each an independent
pressure toward the earth's centre,
as indicated by the arrows. It is plain
that <em>d</em> tends to separate <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, and
will do so if they are left free to move
in a lateral direction. For example, if
<em>e</em> be at the side of a vessel, and an opening be made there,
the downward pressure of <em>d</em> will give <em>e</em> a lateral movement,
forcing it out of the opening.</p>

<p><a name="P_124" id="P_124"></a>
124. <b>Another View.</b>&mdash;To return to Fig. 75, observe
that the lateral pressure at any point in the side of a vessel,
as <em>a</em>, is occasioned <em>wholly</em> by the downward pressure
of a vertical column of particles extending from that point
to the surface. The neighboring columns of particles
have nothing to do with it. The same thing is true in
regard to any other point either in the line A B or another
line drawn on the side of the vessel. It is therefore
true of the whole side, that the pressure upon it is
occasioned alone by the columns of particles that are in
close proximity to the side, and not at all by the other
columns of particles in the vessel. The number of these
columns, therefore, in the vessel, or, in other words, the
breadth of the body of water in it, makes no difference
with the pressure on its side. For this reason two flood-gates
so little apart that a few hogsheads or even pails
of water fill up the space between them, are as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
pressed upon as they would be if a lake or an ocean of
water lay between them. It has been objected to the
project of digging a ship canal between the Red Sea and
the Mediterranean, that as the water in the former is
twenty feet higher than in the latter, it would burst
through the flood-gates with such force as to produce
most disastrous results. But according to the principle
which I have illustrated, there would be no more danger
of this than there would be if two ponds were united by
a canal, in one of which the water is twenty feet higher
than in the other.</p>

125. <b>Pressure in Liquids Equal in all Directions.</b>&mdash;We
are now prepared to go a step farther. The pressure
occasioned by gravitation in fluids operates equally in all
directions when the fluid is at rest. That is, any particle
of a liquid is pressed equally in all directions. If it were
not so it would not remain at rest, but would be moved
in the direction in which the superior
pressure operates. Suppose that <em>a</em>, Fig.
79, is a stratum of particles in a vessel
containing water at rest. The upward
pressure on it being equal to the downward
pressure, the stratum neither rises nor falls. If a
body of liquid be disturbed by wind or any other cause,
those particles which are raised above the common level
in waves are pressed downward more than upward or
laterally in obedience to the action of gravitation. They
therefore move downward, pushing laterally and upward
the neighboring particles, till the liquid regains its level
surface and its state of rest. So, also, if any particles
become heated they are lighter than their neighboring
particles, and the latter being more strongly attracted
than the former, push them upward in order to take their
places. When all the liquid comes to have the same
temperature it is at rest, each particle having an equal
pressure upon it in all directions.</p>

126. <b>Illustrations.</b>&mdash;If a bladder filled with water be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
compressed by the hand, the water is pressed no more
immediately under the hand than in any other part of
the bladder, and wherever an opening be made the water
will rush out with equal readiness. A hose-pipe as
readily bursts upward as in any other direction. A large
cork, if sunk in very deep water, will be uniformly reduced
in its dimensions, showing that it has been pressed
equally on all sides. In the experiments
with the closed bottles (§ 121), the result
is the same if the bottle be so sunk as to
have its mouth downward. If two tubes,
shaped as in Fig. 80, be thrust down into
water, the water will rise with equal facility
in both, although in the straight
one the pressure which carries up the
water is wholly upward, while in the
bent one it is at the first downward.</p>

127. <b>Upward Pressure as the Depth.</b>&mdash;It has been
shown that the downward and the lateral pressures are
as the depth. The same is true of the upward pressure,
for it is produced by the same cause&mdash;the attraction of
the earth. Let us look at this. Why is any particle of
a fluid pressed upward at all? It is from the struggle
on the part of the neighboring particles to get below it.
And why this struggle? It is from the attraction of
gravitation, and so the greater this attraction the greater
is the upward as well as the downward
pressure. The upward pressure
therefore differs at different depths as
the downward pressure does. Thus,
in Fig. 81, the upward pressure against
the layer or stratum of particles, <em>b</em>, is
greater than that against <em>a</em>, for the
same reason that the downward pressure
on <em>b</em> is greater than that on <em>a</em>.
But the two pressures at <em>b</em> are equal, and so are they
at <em>a</em>, and therefore each stratum remains at rest.</p>

<p><a name="P_128" id="P_128"></a>
128. <b>Experiments.</b>&mdash;Some very neat experiments can
be tried, showing that the upward pressure varies with
the depth. Take a large glass tube, A B
C D, Fig. 82, and let there be fitted to
one end a circular plate of brass, which
may be held there by a string, F. Thus
arranged, plunge it quite deep into water,
and you will find that you will not need
to hold on to the string, for the brass disk
will be held tight to the tube by the upward
pressure of the water. Now draw
up the tube slowly, and at length the disk
will fall from the end of the tube. Why?
Because the end of the tube has come to a point where
the upward pressure of the water is less than the downward
pressure of the disk. To have this experiment succeed,
the end of the tube where the disk is applied must
be very even and smooth. Another experiment may be
tried in this way. Tie to one end of a glass tube a piece
of thin India-rubber or bladder, and fill the tube partly
with water. The India-rubber will of course bulge out
or be convex from the weight of the water. Press the
closed end down a little way in a vessel of water, so that
the level in the tube shall be above the level in the vessel.
The India-rubber is still somewhat convex, because,
as the upward pressure upon it is in proportion to its
distance from the surface of the water outside of the
tube, it is not as great as the pressure downward of the
higher water in the tube. Push the tube now so far
down that the level in the tube is the same with that in
the vessel. The India-rubber is now flat, because the
downward and upward pressures upon it are equal, just
as would be the case with a stratum of water in place of
it. But press the tube lower down, and the India-rubber
bulges upward into the tube, because the upward pressure
is now greater than the downward.</p>

129. <b>Great Effects from Small Quantities of a Fluid.</b>&mdash;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
are now prepared to understand the explanation of
some very striking phenomena in the pressure of liquids.
If you take a perfectly tight cask, and, filling it with water,
screw into its top a long tube, by pouring water into
the tube you can burst the cask. To understand this
you must bear in mind two facts&mdash;that the fluid in the
cask is not compressible, and that its particles move freely
among each other. Any pressure, therefore, exerted
upon it is felt through the whole of it equally. "If the
tube," says Dr. Arnot, "have an area of a fortieth of an
inch, and contain when filled half a pound of water, this
produces a pressure of half a pound upon every fortieth
of an inch all over the interior of the cask; which is more
than a common cask can bear." Suppose a small reservoir
of water exists in the side of a mountain wholly
closed up, and that water from a height above finds its
way to it by a crevice, it may by its pressure even burst
open the side of the mountain. And it matters not how
large or small the crevice may be, for pressure in a liquid
is only as the height. If the reservoir be ten yards
square and an inch deep, and the fissure leading to it be
but an inch in diameter and two hundred feet in height,
it is calculated that the pressure of the water in the fissure
would be equal in force to the weight of 5000 tons.</p>

Fig. 83.</div>
</div>

<p><a name="P_130" id="P_130"></a>
130. <b>Explanation.</b>&mdash;The manner in which these effects
are produced may be
made clear by Fig.
83. Let A be a close
vessel filled with water,
and let a tube,
<em>b</em>, be made fast in it,
with a movable plug
or piston at <em>c</em>. If the
surface of the water
be pressed upon by
this piston with the
force of a pound, as the water is incompressible and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
particles are freely movable among each other, the pressure
will be extended equally through all the water, and
every portion of the vessel of equal extent with the tube's
opening at <em>c</em> will be pressed upon with the force of a
pound. If another tube, <em>d</em>, of the same size were inserted
with a piston, <em>i</em>, the force of a pound applied to
the piston <em>c</em> would push upward the piston <em>i</em> with the
same force. And if there were several pistons of the
same size, by pushing upon one with the force of a
pound they would all be pressed upward with exactly
this force. Farther, if <em>e</em> be a tube five times as large as
<em>b</em>, its piston, <em>n</em>, will be forced upward with a pressure of
five pounds by the downward pressure of a pound upon
<em>c</em>. Suppose now that a pound of water were substituted
for the piston <em>c</em>, the other pistons would be pressed upward
as before. And if all the pistons be removed, the
pound of water in <em>b</em> will press the water up the tube <em>d</em>
with the force of a pound, and up the tube <em>e</em> with the
force of five pounds.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-097.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 84.</div>
</div>

<p>To make this still more clear I will present it in a little
different form. Let
B, Fig. 84, be a close
vessel with two tubes,
one of which is five
times as large as the
other. If sufficient
water be poured into
the vessel to occupy a
part of the tubes, it
will stand at the same
height in both tubes,
as indicated. If there
be a pound of water,
then, in the tube <em>c</em>,
there will be five pounds in <em>a</em>. Now if the five pounds
of water in <em>a</em> made any more pressure on the whole body
of water in B than the pound of water in <em>c</em> does, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
press up the water in <em>c</em> to a greater height. But this is
impossible, as has been shown in § 118. Observe that
the five pounds of pressure in <em>a</em> is spread over five times
the area or extent of surface that the pound's pressure in
<em>c</em> is. If the tube <em>c</em> have an area of an inch square, the
water in it will exert a pressure of a pound on every
square inch in the vessel. The water in <em>a</em> exerts a pressure
of five pounds; but it must be remembered that it
does not press with this force on every square inch, but
on every space of five square inches, and that therefore
its pressure on every inch is the same as that in the
tube <em>c</em>.</p>

<p><a name="P_131" id="P_131"></a>
131. <b>Hydrostatic Paradox.</b>&mdash;You see in the phenomena
and explanations given above that a small quantity of a
fluid can, under certain circumstances, exert an enormous
pressure. This fact has been called the Hydrostatic
Paradox. It does seem, at first view, incredible or paradoxical,
when one asserts that a few ounces of water can
be made to raise weights of hundreds or even thousands
of pounds. But the explanations which I have given
show you that there is no unexplainable mystery in the
fact. The cause of it is the same as that which gives a
level surface to liquids; viz., the force of gravitation acting
upon a substance whose particles are freely movable
among each other.</p>

<p><a name="P_132" id="P_132"></a>
132. <b>Hydrostatic Bellows.</b>&mdash;The instrument called the
Hydrostatic Bellows is represented in Fig.
85. It consists of two circular boards, A
and B, united together by strong leather,
and having a tube, C, through which water
can be poured into it. The amount of
weight which can be sustained on the bellows
without forcing the water out of the
tube depends on the size of the bellows.
If the area of the tube is only one thousandth
of that of the top of the bellows, a
pound of water in the tube will balance a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
thousand pounds' weight on the bellows. It is for the
same reason that in Fig. 84 one pound of water in the
tube <em>c</em> balances five pounds in <em>a</em>. As the weight presses
upon the top as a whole, it is the same as if there was a
vessel of the same size with the bellows resting upon it
and containing a thousand pounds of water. The water,
in that case, would stand at the same height in the vessel
and the tube. This shows that the Hydrostatic Paradox
is only one of the exemplifications of the great fact that
a fluid, from the influence of gravitation, seeks to be on
a level. It is the water in the bellows seeking to be on
a level with that in the tube that causes the upward
pressure sustaining the weight.</p>

<p>When the weight on the bellows is less than is required
to balance the water in the tube, the weight can
be raised continually by pouring water into the tube.
But observe that although the lifting force be so strong,
it is very slow in its operation. If the comparative areas
of the tube and the bellows be as above supposed, the
water must fall in the tube ten inches in raising the
weight the one hundredth part of an inch.</p>

133. <b>Bramah's Hydrostatic Press.</b>&mdash;The principles
which I have elucidated have been applied by Mr. Bramah
in his Hydrostatic Press. This consists of a small
metallic forcing-pump,
Fig. 86, in
which the water,
<em>a</em>, is pumped up
by the piston, <em>s</em>,
worked by the
lever, <em>c b d</em>, and
forced into a
strong and large
cylinder, A. In
this cylinder is a
stout piston, S,
having a flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
head, P, above. Between this plate and another, R, is
placed the body, W, which is to be compressed. It is
obvious that the pressure exerted will be in proportion
to the difference between the size of the pump, <em>a</em>, and
the cylinder, A, just as in the case of the bellows, it
depended on the difference between the areas of the tube
and of the top of the bellows. In the press the force of
a pump is substituted for the pressure of a very high
column of water, simply because it is more convenient.
This press is of great service in the mechanic arts. It is
used in pressing paper, cloth, hay, cotton, etc. It has
also been recently used in raising enormous weights.
The tubes of the celebrated bridge over the Straits of
Menai were raised by a machine constructed on this
principle.</p>

<p><a name="P_134" id="P_134"></a>
134. <b>Nature of the Subject.</b>&mdash;We now come to a very
interesting subject, which is at least intimately connected
with Hydrostatics, if it may not be considered a part of
it. The principles which have been developed in the
chapter on Hydrostatics in relation to liquids are to be
applied here to various kinds of substances. And as we
proceed you will see that all the phenomena brought to
view in this chapter are to be referred to the same cause
with those of the previous chapter; viz., the attraction
of gravitation.</p>

<p><a name="P_135" id="P_135"></a>
135. <b>Specific Gravity Defined.</b>&mdash;Before proceeding with
the investigation I will give you the definition of specific
gravity. The specific gravity of any substance is its
weight as compared with the same bulk or volume of
other substances. Water is taken as a standard, and its
specific gravity is for convenience called 1. Mercury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
then, is said to have a specific gravity of 13.5, for it is
thirteen and a half times as heavy as the same volume
of water. It is easy to see how the specific gravities of
different fluids may be ascertained. One mode, and the
most obvious one, is to weigh in a vessel equal quantities
of them. In what way the specific gravities of solids are
ascertained will be explained in another part of this
chapter.</p>

<p><a name="P_136" id="P_136"></a>
136. <b>Action of Gravity on Solids in a Liquid.</b>&mdash;The reason
that a very heavy substance, as a stone, sinks in water
is simply that the earth attracts it more strongly than
it does the water, and so drags the stone down through
it. If the stone lay upon a bladder filled with water, it
would press upon it with the force with which it is attracted
by the earth. But where water is not thus confined,
the stone thrusts its particles to the one side and
the other till it gets to the bottom.</p>

<p>It is the attraction of gravity, also, that makes light
substances, as wood and cork, rise in water. In this
case the water is attracted by the earth more strongly
than the wood or cork, and so gets below it, and in so
doing pushes the lighter substance up above itself.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-101.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 87.</div>
</div>

<p>But you will observe that the wood, on rising in the
water, does not come completely out of it and lie upon
the surface, but a part of it remains immersed in the water.
The explanation of this will furnish you with the
key to the understanding of many very interesting facts.
Suppose that half of a block of wood,
A, Fig. 87, weighing a pound, is
above the surface of water. As it
is attracted to the earth with the
force of a pound, it has pushed to
the one side and the other just a
pound of water, and taken its place.
It is drawn down toward the earth
with the same force with the pound of water on either
side of it, <em>b</em> or <em>c</em>. If it were attracted any more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with the force of a pound, that is, if it weighed more
than a pound, it would displace more than a pound of
water. If it were of just the same weight with the same
volume of water, it would displace a volume of water
equal to itself; it would be wholly immersed, and would
stay any where in the water, wherever you placed it, because
it is attracted by the earth with the same force
that the same bulk of water is.</p>

137. <b>Farther Explanation.</b>&mdash;Suppose water in a vessel
divided into equal portions of a pound
each, as represented in Fig. 88. Now
suppose that the portion <em>a</em> should at once
change into solid ice without at all altering
its bulk or weight. It would not
move from its position, because it is attracted
by the earth precisely as much as
when it was water, and as much as is
each of the equal portions of water around it. But as
water on becoming ice does really increase in bulk, and
therefore become lighter, this block of ice would rise so

<p>The lighter a substance is that is immersed in water,
the more there will be of it above the surface. Take two
blocks of wood of different weights though of the same
size. Suppose the heaviest one,
A, Fig. 89, is one third lighter
than the same bulk of water. One
third of it will be above the surface.
If the other, B, is half the
weight of water, half of it will be
above the surface. We should say, then, that the specific
gravity of the wood in the first block is two thirds
of that of water, and the specific gravity of the wood in
the second is one half that of water.</p>

138. <b>Illustrations.</b>&mdash;There are many interesting facts
that illustrate the principles which I have developed. A
stone is lifted much more easily in water than in air, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>cause
of the support afforded by the upward pressure of
the water. A boy will often wonder why he can lift a
very heavy stone to the surface, but can get it no farther.
When a bucket of water is drawn up a well much less
exertion is required to raise it through the water than
through the air after it emerges from the water. While
it is in the water you raise only the bucket itself, the water
in it having no weight, being sustained by the water
around it. But when it comes to the air you have the
weight of the water added to that of the bucket. When
a person lies in a bath for some time, on raising his arm
from the water it seems to be very heavy. The reason
is, that it has had for so long a time the support of the
water that when it is lifted into the air the want of this
support is sensibly felt, just as we perceive the difference
between raising a bucket of water through water and
raising it through air. It is said that Archimedes took
in the full idea of the principles of specific gravity as his
limbs felt the liquid support of a bath, and so overjoyed
was he with the discovery, that he ran home crying out
all the way, <span title="Eurêka! eurêka">"Εὕρηκα! εὕρηκα!"</span>&mdash;I have found it! I have
found it! It was a rational joy, for he had found a principle
of immense value to science and to the world.</p>

139. <b>Boats and Life-Boats.</b>&mdash;A boat of iron will float
with as much of it out of water as one of wood of the
same size, provided that the iron be made so thin that
the boat is not heavier than the wooden one. For what
is it that floats? Not the iron or wood, but a wooden
or iron boat filled with air. If it were filled with water
instead of air it would sink, the specific gravity of the
materials of which it is built being on the whole of greater
specific gravity than water. Life-boats have in their
structure either a large quantity of cork or air-tight vessels
of tin or copper, and in this way they are made so
light that they will float even when filled with water.</p>

<p>As the weight of a body can be estimated from the
quantity of water which it displaces, we can very readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
estimate the weight of the load of a canal-boat, as its
form is so simple and regular. In order to do this we
must first know how far the boat sinks in the water when
empty, or, in other words, how much water it displaces.</p>

140. <b>Specific Gravity of Animals.</b>&mdash;Birds have a much
less specific gravity than animals that walk, in order that
they may mount up easily in the air. Their light feathers
increase greatly their bulk, as you may see whenever
a bird is stripped of them. Besides this, the bones are
hollow and communicate with the lungs. Birds that
swim, as ducks, swans, etc., have so small a specific
gravity&mdash;that is, are so large in proportion to their
weight&mdash;that but a small part of the body is under water,
and the motion of their feet is not required at all to
sustain them, but only, like the action of oars, to propel
them along. Insects are of small specific gravity, those
that fly the most swiftly being the lightest. Fishes are
very nearly of the same specific gravity with water, and
hence require but little muscular effort to move about in
their element. They are assisted much in rising and falling
by a contrivance by which they can instantaneously
alter their specific gravity. They have an air-bladder,
which they can dilate or contract at pleasure. When
dilated, the bulk of the fish is increased and his specific
gravity lessened, and he rises easily and at once. By
compressing it he as readily sinks.</p>

<p><a name="P_141" id="P_141"></a>
141. <b>Specific Gravity of the Human Body.</b>&mdash;The human
body, when the chest is filled with air, is so much lighter
than water that it will float with about half the head
above the surface. A knowledge of this fact, with proper
presence of mind, might ordinarily save persons from
drowning; for if the body be put in the proper position,
the feet downward and the head thrown backward, the
nose and mouth will be out of the water. So little is required
in the way of support to keep the whole head out
of water, that persons who can not swim are often saved
from drowning by catching hold of very small pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wood. An oar would support half a dozen men, if they
would be satisfied with keeping only the head out of
water; but if each one struggle to get his whole body
upon the oar, they may all be lost.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A life-preserver is
a great aid in preservation from drowning, for it diminishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the specific gravity of the body. It is commonly
an air-tight bag fastened round the upper part of the
body, which can be filled by blowing into it through a
pipe which has a valve in it. "On the great rivers of
China," says Dr. Arnot, "where thousands of people
find it more convenient to live in covered boats upon
the water than in houses on the shore, the younger male
children have a hollow ball of some light material attached
constantly to their necks, so that in their frequent
falls overboard they are not in danger."</p>

<p>When a person is drowned the body sinks because in
the struggle much of the air in the lungs is lost, just as
the fish sinks when his air-bladder is contracted. It is,
however, so little heavier than water after this is done,
that it very readily rises when any gas is produced in it
by putrefaction. It is a common popular notion that firing
cannon over the water will raise the drowned. But
it can produce no effect, unless perhaps the agitation
caused by the concussion may hasten a very little the
rising of a body which from commencing putrefaction is
about to rise.</p>

<p>In wading a river the feet press upon the bottom with
only a force equal to the weight of half the person's head,
this being the difference between the weight of the body
and the weight of the same bulk of water. Now this
pressure is not sufficient to give a sure footing against
even a moderate current. Many persons have been
drowned from ignorance of this fact. A man carrying
a load may often ford a river safely where without a load
to press him down, and thus give him a sure footing, he
would be carried down the stream. So a man may walk
in deep water upon broken glass with impunity.</p>

142. <b>How to Ascertain the Specific Gravity of Solids.</b>&mdash;It
results from the upward pressure of water that a
body weighs less in water than in air. Take a piece of
gold or any other substance, <em>a</em>, Fig. 90 (p. 107), and
weigh it suspended as you see from one of the scales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Introduce the gold now into a cup
of water, and you will find that a
part of the weight must be taken
from the opposite scale to preserve
the balance. The weight which
you take from the scale will be
the weight of a quantity of water
equal in bulk to the piece of gold;
for the immersed body is supported
with a force equal to the weight
of the water it displaces (§ 137).
By comparing, therefore, its
weight in water with its weight in air we determine its
specific gravity. Thus if a lump of gold weigh nineteen
ounces, and on being weighed in water weighs eighteen,
it will prove that gold is nineteen times as heavy as water.
And if a lump of copper weigh nine ounces in air
and eight in water, it is nine times as heavy as water.
Calling water, therefore, 1, the specific gravity of gold is
19, and of copper 9. It is obvious that a body of the
same specific gravity with water would weigh nothing
when immersed in water, for it would be supported with
an upward pressure precisely equal to its own weight,
just as the same bulk of water is. A pound of water,
therefore, will weigh nothing in water. The experiment
can easily be tried. Weigh a glass bottle, suspended on
one arm of the scale-beam, and then put a pound of water
in it. On immersing it in water it will be balanced
if you take out the pound weight in the opposite scale.</p>

143. <b>Archimedes and the Crown.</b>&mdash;Hiero, King of Syracuse,
stipulated for a crown of pure gold. But suspecting
the maker of it of adulterating the gold, he called
upon Archimedes to detect the imposture. He did it in
this way: He procured two lumps of gold and silver of
the same weight with the crown, and observed the quantity
of water which each displaced. He then tried the
crown, and found that it displaced less than the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and more than the gold, and therefore concluded that it
was an alloy of the two metals. All this was suggested
to him by his experience in the bath, referred to in § 138.</p>

144. <b>How to Ascertain the Specific Gravity of Liquids.</b>&mdash;There
are several modes of ascertaining the specific
gravities of different liquids. The instrument called a
Hydrometer furnishes the most common mode. This is
used chiefly in determining the quality of spirit. The
more alcohol and the less water spirit contains the
less is its specific gravity. The Hydrometer consists
of two bulbs of glass, A B, Fig. 91, with a
slender stem, C, which is graduated. In the lower
bulb are a few shot or a little mercury, to give
the instrument its proper weight, and to make its
centre of gravity to be in the lower part. The
lighter the fluid to be tested is the lower will the
instrument sink in it. This is a very accurate instrument,
detecting the slightest adulteration in
spirits. Dr. Arnot tells an amusing story of the
detection of a Chinese trader in liquors. He had sold a
quantity of liquor to the purser of a ship, averring it to
be of the same quality with a sample which he had given
him. The purser tried it with his Hydrometer, and found
it to be of greater specific gravity than the sample. The
Chinese promptly denied the fraud; but on being told
the exact quantity of water which he had added, he was
so much confounded that he immediately confessed his
guilt, and made ample amends. When the Hydrometer
was shown to him he offered a large price for what appeared
to him to be a magical instrument, foreseeing
that it would be of great advantage to him in his business.</p>

<p>In Switzerland and in the north of Italy, where the
peasants bring their milk to a common dairy, and are
allowed a quantity of cheese at the end of the season in
proportion to the amount of milk which they have
brought, a Hydrometer is used to test the quality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
milk. There is a propriety in this, not only as a safe-guard
against adulteration, but because there is a difference
of quality in the milk of different cows, some giving
a much more watery milk than others.</p>

<p><a name="P_145" id="P_145"></a>
145. <b>Centre of Gravity in Floating Bodies.</b>&mdash;The same
principles which apply to the centre of gravity in bodies
standing on a firm basis apply also to floating bodies.
That the centre of gravity may be low in a loaded vessel
the heavy part of the cargo is put underneath, and generally
ballast of stone or iron is necessary for the same
purpose. In large flat-boats, the base of support being
extensive, there is not the same need of taking care that
the centre of gravity be low. If a ship be laden in part
with an article which will dissolve in water, there is much
danger, if the ship should leak, that this portion of the
cargo shall be dissolved and be pumped out with the
bilge-water, thus altering the trim of the vessel, or removing
the centre of gravity from over the middle line,
and bringing it too far forward, or carrying it too far
back, making the ship wholly unmanageable. Four large
English ships, in part loaded with saltpetre, were supposed
to be lost from this cause in 1809 off the Isle of
France. The immense ice-islands, or icebergs, which
float about in summer in the polar regions, by melting
irregularly often change the place of their centre of gravity,
and in turning over present one of the most sublime
spectacles in nature. A mountain of ice, extending high
in the air and deep in the sea, suddenly turns over, and
produces a rolling of the ocean which is often felt at the
distance of many leagues.</p>

146. <b>What Pneumatics Teaches.</b>&mdash;As Hydrostatics
treats of the pressure and equilibrium of liquids, Pneumatics
treats of the same in air and the gases, or aeriform
substances. The name comes from the Greek word <span title="pneuma">πνευμα</span>,
meaning air, breath, spirit.</p>

147. <b>Air Material and has Weight.</b>&mdash;That air is a material
substance has been already proved to you, for it
was shown in § 46 that it has impenetrability, one of the
essential properties of matter. It has extension also, for
bodies of air can be obtained in various shapes confined
in vessels, so that we can speak of cubes and spheres of
air; and besides, the ultimate atoms (§ 15) of air must
have shape or extension. That air has weight can be
proved by weighing it as
you would any other substance.
Let a hollow
globe, A, Fig. 92, having
a neck with a stop-cock,
B, be emptied of air and
weighed. If now you
open the stop-cock, and
so let in the air, the other
beam of the scale will rise,
because the globe is heavier than it was before. The
additional weight required to make the scales balance
will indicate the weight of the air which the globe contains.
It is one eight hundredth (
<span class="blkb">
    <span class="blka">1</span>
    <span class="blka over">800</span>
</span>
) of the weight of
the same volume of water. How the globe can be emptied
of the air will be shown in another part of this chapter.</p>

<p><a name="P_148" id="P_148"></a>
148. <b>Air Attracted by the Earth.</b>&mdash;The weight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
air is simply the result of the attraction of the earth
(§ 52). Air is attracted by the earth just as water is;
and the water takes its place below air because it is attracted
more strongly than the air. It is from the attraction
of the earth that air descends into any hollow
spot in the earth when water is removed from it. It
takes the place of the removed water because from the
influence of attraction it gets as near to the earth as possible.
If you put into a vial mercury, water, and oil, the
mercury will be at the bottom, because it is more strongly
attracted by the earth than the other fluids. The water
will be next, then the oil, and lastly, over all, there is
air, that being less attracted than any of the other substances.
It is this attraction of the air by the earth that
gives us the chief phenomena of Pneumatics.</p>

<p><a name="P_149" id="P_149"></a>
149. <b>Why Some Things Fall and Others Rise in Air.</b>&mdash;Most
substances fall in air for the same reason that very
heavy substances sink in water. They fall because the
earth attracts them more strongly than it does the air.
The reason that some substances rise in air is precisely
the same as that given in § 136 for the rising of substances
in water. The air being attracted more strongly
than they are pushes them up to get below them, as cork
or wood is pushed up by water. Thus a balloon filled
with hydrogen gas rises in air for the same reason that
a bladder filled with air rises in water. So, also, smoke
rises in air, just as oil rises in water.</p>

<p><a name="P_150" id="P_150"></a>
150. <b>Thickness of the Earth's Air-Covering.</b>&mdash;The air
makes a covering for the earth about fifty miles deep.
If the earth were represented by a globe a foot in diameter,
the air might be represented by a covering a tenth
of an inch in thickness. The line <em>a</em>, Fig. 93, gives us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
curve of the surface of such a globe, and the space between
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> represents the comparative thickness of
the covering of air. This is ascertained by calculation
from the pressure of the air upon the earth. It is just as
the depth of water may be calculated from the pressure
which it makes. We do not take this mode of ascertaining
the depth of water, because we can measure it from
the surface by sounding. But we should be obliged to
adopt it if we lived at the bottom of water, as we do at
the bottom of the sea of air.</p>

<p><a name="P_151" id="P_151"></a>
151. <b>How the Air-Covering Adheres to the Earth.</b>&mdash;The
earth flies on in its yearly journey around the sun at the
rate of 1100 miles per minute, and yet it holds on to this
loose airy robe by its attractive force, so that not an atom
of it escapes into the surrounding ether. Of itself it is
disposed to escape; and it would do so, and be diffused
through space, if the attraction of the earth for it were
suspended. For, unlike liquids, the air has no disposition
to keep together; that is, there is no attraction between
its particles. On the other hand, there is a repulsion,
so that they are disposed to keep far apart, and
are kept together only by pressure. It is the pressure
of the earth's attraction that keeps them together to the
extent of fifty miles all around it.</p>

<p><a name="P_152" id="P_152"></a>
152. <b>Compressibility of Air.</b>&mdash;In looking at the influence
of gravitation upon air, it must be remembered that
air is very compressible, while water is very nearly incompressible.
While, therefore, in a body of water the
particles are very little nearer together at the bottom
than at the surface, the particles of the air are much
nearer together close to the earth than they are far away
from it. For as all the particles of the air are attracted
or drawn toward the earth, those below are pressed together
by the weight of those above. The air is therefore
thinner as we go up from the surface of the earth,
and in the outer regions of the sea of air it is too thin to
support life. Even at the tops of very high mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
or the heights sometimes reached by balloons, disagreeable
effects are often experienced from the thinness of
the air. The air has been compared, in regard to its
varying density at different heights, to a heap of loose
compressible substance; as, for example, cotton-wool,
which is quite light at the top, but is pressed more and
more together as you go toward the bottom. Hydrogen
gas has only one fifteenth the weight of air at the surface
of the earth; and therefore the hydrogen balloon rises
till it reaches a height where the air is so thin that the
balloon is of the same weight with an equal bulk of air,
and there it stops.</p>

<p><a name="P_153" id="P_153"></a>
153. <b>In what Aeriform Substances and Liquids are
Alike.</b>&mdash;You have seen in § 36 and § 38 how the air and
gases differ from liquids. But in one very important
respect they are alike, viz., the movability of their particles.
Hence pressure is in air, as well as in water, equal
in all directions, so that in the experiment with the bladder,
in § 126, it makes no difference in the result whether
there be water or air in it. For the same reason
pressure is as the depth in aeriform substances as in liquids,
and the laws of specific gravity apply to the one as
well as to the other.</p>

<p>You are now prepared to understand the results of
<em>the action of gravitation upon air and the gases</em>; or, in
other words, the principal phenomenon of Pneumatics.</p>

<p><a name="P_154" id="P_154"></a>
154. <b>Pressure of the Atmosphere.</b>&mdash;The amount of the
pressure of the atmosphere is very readily estimated, the
mode of doing which I will speak of in another part of
this chapter. It presses with a weight of fifteen pounds
on every square inch. Suppose that you extend your
outspread hand horizontally in the air. You feel no
pressure upon it, but there is a pressure of some two or
three hundred pounds of air upon it. If your hand be
five inches long and three broad it presents a surface of
fifteen square inches, on every one of which the atmosphere
is pressing with the weight of fifteen pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
That is, there is a pressure on the upper surface of your
hand of a column of air weighing 225 pounds. So, also,
on the lid of a box only thirty inches square, there is a
pressure of 13,500 pounds. The whole pressure on the
body of a man of common size is about fifteen tons. But
why is it that the lid of the box is not broken in, your
hand not borne down, and your body not crushed? It
is simply from the fact, shown in the previous chapter
in regard to liquids, and in this in regard to aeriform
substances, that the pressure is equal in all directions.
The lid and the outspread hand are therefore balanced
by an upward pressure equal to the downward, and the
body has the pressure on all sides the same. If the air
could be removed from within the box the lid would be
crushed in; if from under the hand, that would be borne
down; and if from one side of the body, the body would
be forced violently in that direction till it met with an
opposing pressure.</p>

<p>But besides this equal pressure of the air on all sides,
there is air within the pores and interstices of all bodies
that are not very dense, and its particles are subject to
the same laws as are those on the outside.</p>

<p>All this can be made clear to you by the air-pump.</p>

155. <b>Air-pump.</b>&mdash;In Fig. 94 you have a representation
of an air-pump
as commonly arranged.
At <em>a a</em>
are two pump-barrels,
the pistons in
which are worked
by means of the
handle, <em>b</em>. Those
pumps are very nicely
made, and the
frame-work, <em>d e d e</em>,
to which they are
attached, is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
strong and firm, so that the pumps may work evenly.
There is a large, smooth, metallic plate, <em>f</em>. At <em>c</em> is a
bell-shaped glass vessel, close at the top, but open at the
bottom, the edge of which is ground very true, so that
it may fit exactly on the metallic plate. In the middle
of the plate is an opening which leads to the pump-barrels,
and it is through this that the air is pumped out of
the glass receiver, <em>c</em>. If we wish to let the air in after
we have pumped it out we loosen the screw at <em>g</em>, for
from the opening here is a passage to the opening in the
middle of the plate.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-115.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 95.</div>
</div>

<p>The operation of the air-pump can be made clear by
the plan in Fig. 95. But one
pump-barrel, <em>a</em>, is represented,
with a piston, <em>c</em>, working
in it. In the piston there is
a valve, <em>i</em>, opening upward,
and also one at <em>b</em>, in the beginning
of the passage leading
to the centre of the plate
where is the receiver, <em>d</em>. The
working of the instrument is
thus: If the piston be forced
down, the air under it, being compressed, will close the
valve at <em>b</em>, and will rush upward through the valve <em>i</em> in
the piston. Let the piston now be raised; the resistance
of the air above it will close the valve <em>i</em>, while the
valve <em>b</em> will be opened by the air rushing from the receiver,
<em>d</em>, through the passage, <em>e</em>, to fill the space between
the piston and <em>b</em>. You see, then, that every time that the
piston is drawn up air passes out of the receiver through
the valve <em>b</em> into the space between this valve and the
piston. None of this air which has passed out can go
back again, for the moment that you press upon it by
forcing downward the piston the valve <em>b</em> is shut down,
and the air escapes from the pressure by passing out
through the valve <em>i</em>. Each time, therefore, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
work the piston up and down you pump out some of the
air from the receiver; and if you pump for some time
there will be exceedingly little air left in it, and that will
of course be diffused throughout the receiver. It will
be thin, like that in the upper regions of the atmosphere.</p>

156. <b>Experiments.</b>&mdash;When the receiver is full of air it
can be moved about on the plate easily, and can be lifted
from it. But work the pumps a few strokes and you
will find that the receiver is firmly fastened to the plate,
for the air within, being made thin, presses with little
force compared with the air outside. If the pumps be
worked for some time no force could release the receiver
from the pressure without breaking it. But loosen the
screw, <em>g</em>, and thus let the air in, and the equality of the
pressure on the outside and inside is at once restored.
Take off now this large receiver, and place a small glass
jar, open at both ends, on the plate, with the hand covering
the upper opening, as represented in Fig. 96. On
exhausting the air the
hand is so firmly pressed
into the glass that it requires
considerable force
to disengage it from the
pressure. If we tie a piece
of bladder or India rubber
over this jar, as in Fig. 97, and then pump out the air,
the bladder at first is pressed in as represented, and if
we pump on it at length bursts
with a loud report. It would
make no difference in the result
of the experiment if the jar were
shaped as in Fig. 98, for the
pressure is the same in all directions.
The resemblance between
air and liquids in this respect
may be illustrated thus: Suppose
that a flat fish covers with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
one of its sides the end of the tube of a pump. He feels
no uncomfortable pressure, because the water in the
pump and that below it press equally upon him. If, now,
the pressure of the water in the pump could be suddenly
taken off by the piston, the fish would be pressed upward
into the tube, as the bladder is pressed upward in Fig.
98, or downward in Fig. 97, or as the hand is pressed
downward in Fig. 96.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Magdeburg Hemispheres,
Fig. 99, illustrate very impressively
the pressure of the
atmosphere. They consist
of two hemispheres whose
edges at A fit very accurately
upon each other. The air is exhausted through the
stem where you see the stop-cock, and then the handle
B is screwed on. The force required to pull these hemispheres
apart depends upon the extent of their surface.
In the famous experiment at Magdeburg, in 1654, by
Otto von Guericke, the inventor of the air-pump, two
strong hemispheres of brass of a foot in diameter were
employed, and it required the force of thirty horses to
separate them. In Fig. 100 you see a receiver
with an opening at the top. Cemented in
this opening is a wooden cup, <em>a</em>, terminating
in a cylindrical piece, <em>b</em>. If mercury be poured
into the cup, on exhausting the air from the
receiver the mercury will be forced through
the pores of the wood by the external air, and
will fall in a silver shower. A tall jar, <em>c</em>, is placed there
to receive it, to prevent any of it from going down into
the opening in the metallic plate.</p>

157. <b>The Sucker.</b>&mdash;The boy's sucker illustrates
the pressure of the air. It is simply a
circular piece of leather with a string fastened
to its centre, as seen in Fig. 101. When the
leather is moistened and pressed upon a smooth
stone, on pulling the string a vacuum is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
between the middle of the leather and the stone, and the
leather adheres by its edges to the stone, just as the receiver
adheres to the plate of the air-pump when the air
is pumped out. There are many animals that have contrivances
of a similar character. The gecko and the cuttle-fish
furnish interesting examples, as noticed in my
Natural History, pages 198 and 320. Snails, limpets, etc.,
adhere to rocks by a like arrangement. Some fishes do
the same. There is one fish called the remora, that attaches
itself by suckers to the side of some large fish or
a ship, and thus enjoys a fine ride through the water,
without any exertion on his part. In all such cases it
is water instead of air that makes the pressure, but the
principle is the same. Flies and some other insects can
walk up a smooth pane of glass, or along the ceiling over-head,
because their feet have contrivances akin to the
boy's sucker. The hind-feet of the walrus are constructed
somewhat like the feet of the fly, enabling this huge
animal to go up smooth walls of ice.</p>

158. <b>Density of the Air Dependent upon Pressure.</b>&mdash;The
fact that the degree of the density of the air is dependent
on pressure has been already shown in § 152.
The same thing can be shown in various ways with the
air-pump. If a small bladder, partly filled with air, Fig.
102, and loaded with a weight so as to sink
in water, be placed in a jar of water, and the
whole be set under the receiver of the air-pump,
on exhausting the air the bladder will
swell out with the expanded air in it, and
will rise as seen in the figure. The reason
is, that the pressure being taken off the surface
of the water, the bladder bears only the
pressure of the water, and not that of the
air with the water, and so the air in it expands and becomes
less dense. If an India-rubber bag be partly filled
with air, Fig. 103 (p. 119), and put under the receiver,
on exhausting the air, the surrounding pressure being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
thus taken off from the bag, the air in it becomes
expanded, that is, rarefied. For the
same reason, if a vessel with soap-bubbles in it
be placed under the receiver, on pumping out
the air the bubbles will become much enlarged.
A very pretty experiment illustrating the same
thing may be tried in this way. Let an egg
with a hole made in its small end be suspended in a receiver,
as represented in Fig. 104, a wine-glass being beneath
it. On exhausting the air the egg
will all run out of the shell into the wine-glass,
and then, on admitting the air, it
will run back again into the shell. The
explanation is this: There is air in the
large end of the egg. As soon as the
pressure of air is taken off from all about
the egg the air in the egg expands, forcing
out the contents; but when the air is
admitted into the receiver the air in the
egg is at once condensed into its former small bulk by
the surrounding pressure.</p>

159. <b>Hydrostatic Balloon.</b>&mdash;The philosophical toy represented
in Fig. 105 illustrates very beautifully
the influence of pressure upon the density of
the air. The balloon in the jar of water is of
glass, with a small orifice at its lower part.
Care must be taken in putting water in the
balloon to have just enough to make it of a little
less specific gravity than water. In that
case it will be at the top of the jar, with a very
little of its top above the surface of the water.
Now tie a piece of India-rubber cloth over the
top of the jar, and the apparatus is complete.
On pressing upon the India rubber the balloon
will go down in the jar, and on taking off the
pressure it will rise. The explanation is this:
The pressure upon the India rubber is felt through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
whole body of the water in the jar, and forces a little
more water into the orifice of the balloon, condensing
the air that is there. The balloon consequently becomes
heavier, and has a greater specific gravity than water,
and sinks in it. But when the pressure is taken off, the
condensed air in the balloon, by its elasticity, returns to
its former bulk, expelling the surplus water just
introduced, and the balloon, becoming therefore
as light as before, rises. Grotesque figures
of glass may be managed in the same way.
The Cartesian image, Fig. 106, is an example.
This has air in its upper part, <em>a</em>, and water up
to <em>c d</em>. When pressure is made on the India
rubber more water is forced into the image
through the tail, <em>b</em>, and it goes down like the
balloon, to rise again when the pressure is
taken off.</p>

160. <b>Air in Substances.</b>&mdash;I have said that there is air
in the pores and interstices of wood, flesh, and
a great variety of substances. In all these cases
the presence of the air can be made manifest by
taking off the pressure of the surrounding air,
and thus allowing the air in these substances to
expand. If an egg be placed in a jar of water,
Fig. 107, under the receiver of an air-pump, on
exhaustion being made air-bubbles will constantly
rise in the water from the egg. So, too, a
glass of porter, Fig. 108, will have its surface covered
with foam, the carbonic acid gas in it escaping
freely when the pressure of the air upon it is
taken off. The same thing may be seen to
some extent even in water, for it always contains
some air. For the same reason a shriveled
apple, with the pressure of the air taken
from it, will become plump and fair, but will
shrink at once to its shriveled state when the
air is admitted into the receiver.</p>

161. <b>Elasticity of the Air.</b>&mdash;All the phenomena cited in
§ 158, § 159, and § 160 exhibit the elasticity of the air.
It is from this property that it is always disposed to expand.
It will do so whenever pressure is taken from it,
or when it can overcome pressure to which it is subjected.
This property is most strikingly exhibited when the
air is much condensed by pressure. And the greater the
condensation the stronger is the expansive or elastic force.</p>

162. <b>The Condenser.</b>&mdash;In Fig. 109 you have the plan
of an instrument called the Condenser.
In A B, a cylinder, moves the piston, P.
Air is admitted to the cylinder at F, and
into the receiver, V, at G. The valve at
F prevents any air from escaping from
the cylinder, and the valve at G prevents
it from escaping from the receiver. The
operation of the instrument is this: If the
piston be pressed downward, the pressed
air in the cylinder shuts the valve F and
opens G, and so enters the receiver V.
If now the piston be raised, air rushes in
at F to fill the space in the cylinder. It
can not come from V, because the valve
G is shut by its pressure. By working
the piston for some time you can get a
body of air into V of very great density.
You see that this instrument is the very
opposite of the air-pump. In the receiver, V, you have
condensed air, while in the receiver of the air-pump you
have rarefied air. If you compare the two instruments
you will see that the opposite results are owing to different
arrangement of the valves.</p>

163. <b>The Gasometer.</b>&mdash;Gas is distributed in pipes from
the gasometer at the gas factory by the agency of the
elasticity occasioned by condensation under pressure.
The apparatus, Fig. 110 (p. 122), consists of a large
round vessel, G, open below, and sunk in a larger ves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>sel
of water, <em>w</em>. We will
suppose the vessel, G, to
be full of water. Gas is introduced
into it through
the pipe, <em>p r</em>, the gasometer
rising as it fills with
the gas. P is a weight balancing
the gasometer, and
so permitting it to rise as
the gas enters. The gasometer
being filled, the gas
is to be distributed. For this purpose weights are put
upon the gasometer, so that the gas may be compressed.
Under this pressure it by its elasticity seeks for more
room, and obtains it by escaping through the pipe <em>o b c</em>.
As the pressure on the gas needs to be regulated, there
is sometimes a gauge, <em>h i</em>, attached, which shows the
amount of the pressure. It is a bent tube with water in
the bend. You see at once that the greater the pressure
upon the gas the higher will the water be in the branch,
<em>h</em>, of the gauge.</p>

164. <b>Air-Guns and Pop-Guns.</b>&mdash;These illustrate the
elasticity of condensed air. The air-gun is constructed
in this way: A receiver, like V, Fig. 109, is made so that
you can screw it on and off from the instrument. After
being charged with condensed air it is screwed upon the
gun, its stem communicating with the barrel. In order
to discharge the gun there is a contrivance connected
with the trigger for raising the valve, G, so that some of
the condensed air may enter the barrel. On doing so, it
by its sudden expansion rapidly forces out the contents.
The principle on which the common pop-gun operates is
the same. There is air confined between the two corks,
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, Fig. 111 (p. 123). As the rod, R, is pushed quickly
in, the cork <em>b</em> is carried nearer to <em>a</em>, so that the air between
them is condensed. With the condensation the expansive
force is increased; and when it becomes so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that the cork <em>a</em> can no longer resist it, it throws the cork
out, and so quickly as to occasion the popping sound.</p>

<p><a name="P_165" id="P_165"></a>
165. <b>Powder and Steam.</b>&mdash;The explosion of powder
furnishes a good illustration of the expansive force of
condensed air or gases. These gases are produced so
suddenly from the powder that at the instant they are in
a very condensed state, and therefore expand powerfully.
So, also, steam has power in proportion to its condensation.
When formed under the confinement of a boiler,
on being allowed to escape it expands with great force.
The application of the expansive power of steam will be
treated of particularly in another part of this book.</p>

166. <b>Retardation by Condensed Air in Gunnery.</b>&mdash;When
a ball is fired it is constantly retarded in its flight
by the resistance of the air, for it has to push the air
away on every side in order to make its way through it.
Of course, then, the more condensed the air is the greater
is the resistance. Now it is condensed air that the
ball is obliged to remove; for as it goes forward it, by
its rapid pressure, condenses the air directly before it.
And the more rapid is its flight the greater is the condensation,
and therefore the greater the resistance. Besides,
the retarding effect is increased by the tendency to
a vacuum behind the ball. All
this can be made clear by Fig.
112. Let B be a ball going very
rapidly in the direction indicated
by the arrow, the cloud representing
the condensed air before
it, and the space included in the two lines the vacuum
behind it. It is obvious that the more rapidly the ball
goes the less readily is the air pressed out of the way,
and therefore the more it is condensed in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ball. At the same time the more rapid is the ball the
less readily does the air close up behind it, and therefore
the greater is the tendency to a vacuum there. For
these reasons there is more retarding influence exerted
by the air upon a ball in the first part of its course than
in its latter part.</p>

167. <b>Pressure of the Air on Liquids.</b>&mdash;If you plunge a
tumbler into a vessel of water, and turning it over hold
it so that its open part is just under the surface, it will
remain full. The reason
is that the weight
of the air pressing upon
the surface of the water
in the vessel prevents
the water in the tumbler
from passing downward.
Now if you introduce
a bent tube
under the tumbler, as
in Fig. 113, and blow
through it, the air that
you force up into the
tumbler presses the water
down, taking its place. That is, the pressure of the
air acts in opposition to the pressure of the air outside
upon the surface of the water in the vessel. You take
a jar, <em>a</em>, Fig. 114, and filling it with
water, turn it over with its open end
downward, the water will remain in
the jar. You have here a representation
of the pneumatic trough used
by the chemist in collecting gases.
To fill the jar <em>a</em> with gas he puts the
mouth of the retort from which the
gas issues under the jar <em>a</em>, and the gas passing upward
expels the water, as the water is expelled by the breath
from the tumbler in Fig. 113. In Fig. 115 (p. 125) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
represented an experiment which shows not only
that the pressure of the air sustains the column
of water in the cases cited above, but also that
it makes no difference in what direction this
pressure is exerted. Take a large tube, <em>a</em>, closed
at one end and open at the other, and fill it even
full with water. Place, now, a piece of writing-paper
over its mouth, and carefully invert the
tube, as seen in the figure. The paper will remain, and
the water will not run out. It is the pressure of the air
that sustains the water, and the paper only serves to
maintain the surface of the water unbroken. If the paper
were not there the particles of the air would insinuate
themselves among those of the water, and pass upward
in the tube. You can try this experiment with a
wine-glass, and may even succeed with a tumbler. We
see in these experiments the reason that a liquid will not
run from a barrel when it is tapped, if there be no vent-hole
above, unless there be so large an opening made as
to let the air work its way in bubbles among portions
of the liquid. It is this entrance of the air that causes
the gurgling sound in pouring a liquid from a bottle.</p>

<p><a name="P_168" id="P_168"></a>
168. <b>Amount of Atmospheric Pressure.</b>&mdash;If, instead of
the jar <em>a</em>, in Fig. 114, you have a tube thirty-four feet
high, and closed at the top, situated as the jar <em>a</em> is, it
will remain full of water. If the tube be longer the water
will stand only at thirty-four feet, leaving a vacuum
above it. It makes no difference what the size of the
tube is; the result will be the same in all cases.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That
is, a column of water thirty-four feet high can be sustained
by the pressure of the atmosphere. It is easy, therefore,
to estimate the weight or pressure of the air. The
pressure of the column of water is found to be fifteen
pounds to the square inch of its base, and this, of course,
is the amount of pressure or weight of the atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>which it balances. Mercury is thirteen and a half times
as heavy as water, and therefore the air will sustain a
column of it only about thirty inches in height.</p>

169. <b>Barometer.</b>&mdash;The weight of the atmosphere varies
to some extent at different times, and the
barometer is an instrument for measuring these
variations. It is constructed on the principles
developed in the previous paragraphs. In Fig.
116 is a representation of the instrument. A
B is a glass tube about 34 or 35 inches long,
closed at one end. It has been filled with mercury,
and then inverted in a cup of the same
liquid, C. The vacuum above the mercury is
called the Torricellian vacuum, from Torricelli,
an Italian, who first developed the principles
of the instrument. The mercury generally, as
stated in § 168, stands at about the height of
thirty inches. But it varies from this with
the weather. When the weather is bright and
clear the air is heavier than this, and, pressing
upon the mercury in the vessel, forces it up
higher in the tube. But when a storm is coming
the air is apt to be lighter, and therefore
pressing less strongly on the mercury in the vessel, the
mercury in the tube falls. The barometer is of great
service, especially at sea, in affording the sailor warning
of an approaching storm. An incident is related by Dr.
Arnot which strikingly illustrates its value in this respect.
He was at sea in a Southern latitude. As the
sun set after a beautiful afternoon the captain foresaw
danger, although the weather was perfectly calm, for the
mercury in the barometer had suddenly fallen to a remarkable
degree. He gave hurried orders to the wondering
sailors to prepare the ship for a storm. Scarcely
had the preparations been made when a tremendous hurricane
burst upon the ship, tearing the furled sails to
tatters, and disabling the masts and yards. If the ba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>rometer
had not been observed the ship would have been
wholly unprepared, and shipwreck, with the loss of all
on board, would have been the result.</p>

<p>A water-barometer could be made, but it would be an
unwieldy thing, for the tube must be over 34 feet long.
Besides, it would not answer in very cold weather, as
the water would freeze. So short a column of the heavy
fluid, mercury, balances the weight of the atmosphere
that a barometer made with this is of very convenient
size; and then there is no danger of the mercury's freezing,
except in the extreme cold of the Arctic regions.</p>

<p><a name="P_170" id="P_170"></a>
170. <b>Barometer a Measurer of Heights.</b>&mdash;The atmosphere,
as stated in § 152, diminishes regularly in density
as we go upward. The rate of this diminution has been
accurately ascertained, and therefore we can estimate
heights by the amount of pressure on the mercury in the
barometer. At a height of 500 feet the barometer will
be half an inch lower than in the valley below. At the
summit of Mont Blanc it stands but half as high as at its
foot, indicating a height of 15,000 feet. Du Luc, in his
famous balloon ascension from Paris, saw the barometer
at one time standing at about twelve inches, showing an
elevation of 21,000 feet.</p>

<p><a name="P_171" id="P_171"></a>
171. <b>Relation of the Air's Pressure to the Boiling Point.</b>&mdash;Water
heated to 212 degrees of Fahrenheit boils, that
is, it becomes vapor. Now if water be heated on the
summit of a high mountain it boils before it arrives at
this degree of temperature. On the top of Mont Blanc
it boils at 180 degrees, that is, 32 degrees below the
boiling point of water at the foot of the mountain. This
is because the pressure of the air acts in opposition to
the change of water in to vapor, and the less the pressure
is the less heat will be required to vaporize the water.
We may illustrate this influence of the pressure of air
upon boiling by the following experiment. Let a cup of
ether (which boils at 98 degrees) be placed under the
receiver of an air-pump. On rarefying the air by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pump the ether will boil. The general effect of pressure
upon boiling may be prettily illustrated by another experiment.
Boil some water in a thin flask over a spirit-lamp.
Blow out the lamp, and, corking the flask tightly,
let the boiling cease. If, now, you pour some cold
water over the flask the boiling will commence again
with considerable force. Why? Because you condense
the steam which is over the water by the application of
cold, and thus take off the pressure. Then, again, if,
while the water is boiling, you pour hot water over the
flask, the boiling ceases, because the heat favors the accumulation
of steam, and therefore renews the pressure
on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>You can see from what has been stated that most liquids
have the liquid form because of the pressure of the
atmosphere upon them. If there were no atmosphere,
ether, alcohol, the volatile oils, and even water, would
fly off in vapor; and the earth would be enveloped in a
vaporous robe, for the particles of the vapors would be
held to the earth by attraction, just as the particles of
the air are now, § 151.</p>

172. <b>Syphon.</b>&mdash;The pressure of air upon fluids is beautifully
exemplified in the operation
of the syphon. This
instrument is simply a bent
tube having one branch longer
than the other. Its operation
is shown in Fig. 117.
The tube having been first
filled with the liquid, has its
shorter branch in the liquid
of the vessel A, which is to
be emptied, and the other in
the vessel B, which is to receive
the liquid. As you see
it here, the opening of the
long branch is below the surface of the liquid in B. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
is manifest, therefore, that the air presses equally upon
the surfaces in both vessels, tending to support the fluid
in the tube, just as the fluid is supported in the jar in
Fig. 114. But, notwithstanding these equal pressures,
the liquid runs up the tube from A, and down its longer
branch into B. Why is this? As the pressure of a column
of fluid is as its height, there is greater pressure or
weight in the longer branch than in the other; and it is
this difference in weight that causes the flow from A into
B through the syphon. The difference in the columns
in the two branches is not the difference in length of
these branches, but the distance between the levels of
the fluid in A and B, that is, the distance from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>.
The operation, then, of the instrument is this. There is
a constant tendency to a vacuum at C, the bend of the
tube, from the influence of gravitation on the excess of
fluid in the long branch over that in the short one. This
tendency is constantly counteracted by the rise of fluid
in the short branch, it being forced up by the pressure
of the air upon the surface of the fluid in A.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-130a.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 119.</div>
</div>

<p>If the syphon were so placed that the surface of the
liquid in A is precisely on a level with that in B, as represented
in Fig. 118, the
liquid would remain at
rest, for as pressure is
as the height, § 121, and
the pressures on the two
surfaces are equal, there
would be an exact balance.
But let the surface
in B be in the least lower than in A and the flow
will begin. And the greater the distance between the
two levels the more rapid will be the flow, for the greater
will be the influence of gravitation in the long branch.</p>

<p>Again, if the end of the long branch of the syphon be
free, as in Fig. 119 (p. 130), the syphon will operate in
the same way, for the air, pressing in all directions equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>ly,
tends to support the column of
fluid in the long branch by a direct
upward pressure, but is prevented
from doing so by the excess of fluid
in it above what is in the shorter
one. The operation of the syphon is
commonly represented in this way;
but I have given first the arrangement
in Fig. 117, in order that you
might more clearly see the principle
of the instrument.</p>

173. <b>Uses of the Syphon.</b>&mdash;The syphon is used chiefly
for discharging liquids from one barrel or vessel into another.
For convenience, it is often
constructed after the plan of Fig. 120.
To the long branch, B C, is attached
the tube ED. It is used in this way:
The end of the short branch, A, being
introduced into the liquid to be drawn
off, you place your finger upon C, and
after filling the syphon by suction at
E, you remove the finger and let the
liquid run. The syphon has sometimes
been used to drain pits and
mines. It of course can never be
used where the elevation over which the tube is to bend
is over 34 feet from the surface of the water to be discharged,
for then the air would not press the water up
to the bend of the syphon.</p>

174. <b>Cup of Tantalus.</b>&mdash;This cup, Fig. 121, has a syphon
in it, the short branch, <em>b</em>, opening into the
cup, and the long branch, <em>d</em>, having its outlet in
the bottom. As you pour water into the cup it
will remain there until you pour enough in to
cover the bend of the syphon. As soon as this
is done, the syphon being filled, the water suddenly
flows out from the outlet, <em>a</em>, of the long branch.</p>

175. <b>Intermitting Springs.</b>&mdash;The operation of an intermitting
spring is essentially the same with that of the
cup of Tantalus.
You have a representation
of such
a spring in Fig.
122. There is a
cavity in a hill,
supplied with water
from a passage
above. There
is also a passage
from it which takes a bend upward like a syphon. Now
when the water in the cavity is low it will not run out
from the syphon-like channel; but when the cavity becomes
filled above the level of the bend the water will
at once flow out, just as it does from the cup of Tantalus
as soon as the bend of its syphon is covered.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="P_176" id="P_176"></a>
176. <b>Pumps.</b>&mdash;In Fig. 123 you have a plan of a common
pump. A tube, C D, extends down
into the well, W. Above this is the
barrel of the pump, A B, in which the
piston works up and down. There is a
valve, F, in the piston, and another, E,
at the bottom of the barrel. Both of
them open upward. We will suppose
that the pump is entirely empty of water.
If, now, the piston descend, the
valve E shuts down, and F opens, letting
the pressed air between the piston
and E pass upward. See what will
happen when the piston rises. The air
above the piston can not get below, for
its pressure will shut the valve F. But
there will be a tendency to a vacuum
below the piston as it rises, and the air
will go up through the valve E to fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
up the space. But why does the air rise? Because of
the pressure of the air upon the surface of the water in
the well. This forces up in the pump the water and the
air above it, just in proportion as the downward pressure
in the pump is lessened. If the pumping be continued
all the air will soon be expelled, the water following
it and flowing out at the opening, G. It is obvious that
the pump will be useless if the valve E be over 34 feet
above the surface of the water in the well, as the pressure
of the atmosphere will not sustain a column of water
higher than this.</p>

<p><a name="P_177" id="P_177"></a>
177. <b>Suction.</b>&mdash;In common language, the operation of
the pump is attributed to what is called a principle of
suction, as if there was a drawing up of the water. But
the water, you see, is not drawn, but forced, up. So it
is with all operations of a similar character. In sucking
up a fluid through a tube the fluid is forced up, because
the pressure downward in the tube is removed. But
how is it removed? It is done by a movement of the
tongue downward from the roof of the mouth, thus causing
a tendency to a vacuum, as the upward movement
of the piston in the pump causes this tendency under it.
To fill the space made by the movement of the tongue
the air is forced up the tube, the
liquid following; and, as in the case
of the pump when the air is all expelled,
the liquid will begin to discharge
into the mouth.</p>

178. <b>Forcing-Pump.</b>&mdash;The forcing-pump
is constructed differently from
the common pump. Its plan is given
in Fig. 124. It has a pipe, C D, and
a barrel, A B, like the common pump.
It has also the valve E at the bottom
of the barrel. But it has no valve in
the piston. Connected with the barrel
is another pipe, F G, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the water issues. This has a valve, H, opening upward.
The operation of the pump is obvious. As the piston is
drawn up E opens and H shuts, and when it is forced
down E shuts and H opens.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">
Fig. 125.</div>
</div>

<p><a name="P_179" id="P_179"></a>
179. <b>Fire-Engine.</b>&mdash;The fire-engine has commonly two
forcing-pumps, with a contrivance
for making the water issue in a
uniform stream. This contrivance
can be explained in Fig. 125. The
discharging pipe, L M, extends
down into a large vessel, I K, which
is filled with air. The uniformity
of the stream depends upon the
elastic force of compressed air, as
you will see if I explain the operation
of the machine. When the
water is forced through the opening
H, it rises to the level N O,
compressing the air in I K, for the
tube L M is too small to allow all
the water to escape that comes from the larger tube, H E.
Now the moment that the piston ceases to force the
water through H, the elastic force of the compressed air
operates, shutting down the valve H, and forcing the
water up L M. The result, you see, is a continuous
forcing up of the water through this tube, and therefore
a uniform stream.</p>

<span class="fs80">MOTION.</span></h3>


<p><a name="P_180" id="P_180"></a>
180. <b>Universality of Motion.</b>&mdash;The world is full of motion.
The rising and setting of the sun, the changes of
the seasons, the falling of the rain, the running of rivers
into the ocean, the ascent of water into the air by evap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>oration,
the wind moving in silence or rushing on in its
might, are familiar examples of motion constant and every
where present. But with all this motion, sometimes
in conflict and often variable, order and regularity reign.
The causes of motion, though various in their operation,
are kept by the Creator from producing confusion and
disorganization by a few simple laws, which regulate the
movements both of atoms and of worlds. The principal
of these causes I will now briefly notice.</p>

<p><a name="P_181" id="P_181"></a>
181. <b>Causes of Motion.</b>&mdash;Attraction is the most universal
of the causes of motion in the universe. While
it binds atom to atom, it also binds system to system
throughout the immensity of space; and while it makes
the stone fall to the ground, it moves the countless orbs
forever onward in their courses. It is this which causes
the tides to flow and the rivers to run down their slopes
to the ocean, and thus by keeping up the never-ending
motion of water all over the earth in seas, lakes, rivers,
and the millions of little streamlets, diffuses life and
beauty over the vegetable world, and gives to man the
vast resources which we see developed in the numberless
applications of water-power and navigation.</p>

<p>Heat pervades all matter, and is every where uniting
its influence with the other causes of motion. It is heat
that produces all the motions of the air, termed winds.
It is heat that causes the rise of the water all over the
earth in evaporation, so that it may be collected in
clouds, again to descend to moisten the earth and keep
the ever-flowing rivers full. Heat applied to water gives
to man one of his best means of producing motion in
machinery.</p>

<p>The agencies which Chemistry reveals to us are ever
at work causing motion among the particles of matter;
and though they generally work in silence, they sometimes
show themselves in tremendous explosions, and in
convulsions of nature.</p>

<p>Busy life is every where producing motion, more es<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>pecially
in the animal world. It gives to the myriads of
animals, great and small, that swarm the earth not only
the power of moving themselves, but also the power, to
some extent, of moving the material world around them.</p>

<p><a name="P_182" id="P_182"></a>
182. <b>Action and Reaction Equal.</b>&mdash;When any of the
causes of motion act, the action is met by an opposite
and equal reaction. If, for example, a blow be given, an
equal blow is received in return. For this reason, if one
in running hits his head against the head of another
both are equally hurt. When a child knocks his head
against a table, there is sound philosophy in the common
saying that he has given the table as good a blow as
he has received, though it may afford him no comfort.
Many very interesting illustrations of this law of motion
suggest themselves, of which I will give a few.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-136.jpg" width="150" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 126.</div>
</div>

<p>A swimmer, pressing the water downward and backward
with his hands and feet, is carried along forward
and upward by the reaction of the water. And in this
case, as in every other, the greater the action the greater
is the reaction; in other words, the more strongly he
presses with his hands and feet, the more rapidly is he
borne along by the reaction of the water against the
pressure. A boat advances in proportion to the force
with which the oars press against the water. So the
rapidity of a steamboat depends on the force with which
the paddles drive the water astern. Birds rise in the
air by the reaction of the air against their wings as they
are pressed downward. A sky-rocket pursues its rapid
flight because a large quantity of gaseous matter issues
from its lower end, and, being resisted by the reaction
of the air, by its pressure throws the rocket upward. So
if a ship fire guns from the stern its advance will be accelerated,
but if from the bow it will be retarded. When
a broadside is fired the ship inclines to the other side.
In Fig. 126 (p. 136) is represented the plan of Barker's
mill. It consists of a cylinder, <em>c</em>, arranged in a frame in
such a way that it can revolve on the point upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
it rests. Water runs into it by a tube,
<em>p</em>, and escapes by the branches, <em>a</em> and
<em>d</em>. These are so arranged that the reaction
upon the issuing water makes
the cylinder revolve rapidly, causing
the ends of the branches to whirl
around as indicated by the dotted
lines and arrows.</p>

<p>If a spring be compressed between
two equal bodies, it will throw them
off with equal velocities. If they are
unequal, the velocity of the smaller
body will be greater than that of the larger, and in proportion
to its smallness. For this reason, when a ball
issues from a cannon, though the cannon and the ball are
equally acted upon by the elastic or expansive force of
the gases set free by lighting the powder, the gun is
moved but very little because the force is diffused through
so large a mass, while the ball being so much smaller
moves with great velocity. When a volcano throws
stones from its crater the earth may be compared to the
cannon, the stones to the ball, and the explosive materials
throwing the stones to the exploding powder projecting
the ball. As the cannon is moved as much as the
ball, so is the earth moved as much as the stones, the
only reason that it does not move as far and as rapidly
as the stones being that the force is diffused through so
large a bulk. These examples illustrate very well the
relation of action and reaction, for whenever there is an
action of one body upon another it is as if a spring were
between the two bodies, acting equally upon both. When
a man jumps from the ground it is as if a spring were
compressed between him and the earth, and this expanding
moves the earth exactly as much as it does the man.
He really kicks the earth away from him. The motion
of the earth is not obvious because it is diffused through
so large a mass. The case is parallel to that of the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and cannon. The same force is exerted upon the man
and the earth, but the man, like the ball, moves the
most, and in proportion to his comparative smallness.
So when a bird hops from the ground, the earth moves
as really as the bird. If the bird hop from a twig, you
perceive that the twig is moved by the pressing down
of the bird as it rises. When it starts from the ground
it exerts the same downward pressure, and moves the
earth as really as in the other case it did the twig.</p>

<p><a name="P_183" id="P_183"></a>
183. <b>Inertia Shown in the Communication of Motion.</b>&mdash;What
is meant by the inertia of matter you have already
learned in § 48. This property is exemplified in the communication
of motion to any body, or, in other words, in
setting it in motion. Of this I will give some illustrations.
When the sails of a vessel are first spread to the
wind the vessel does not move swiftly at once, for some
time is required for the force applied to overcome the
inertia of so large a mass, and to put it in rapid motion.
Horses make a greater effort to start a load than they do
to keep it in motion after it is started. If one be standing
up in a carriage, and the horses start off suddenly,
he falls backward, because his body, from its inertia, does
not readily and at once partake of the motion of the carriage.
If a person start forward quickly with a waiter
filled with glasses in his hands, the glasses will slide backward.
So if a person start quickly from his chair with a
cup of tea in his hand, the tea will be thrown backward
upon him.</p>

<p>You see from the foregoing illustrations that it requires
some time to communicate motion to any body. I will
give some illustrations of this fact of a more striking
character. If a ball be thrown against an open door it
will move the whole door, and perhaps shut it; but the
same ball if fired will pass through the door without
moving it perceptibly. In the latter case its velocity is
so great that there is not time enough to communicate
motion to the whole door, and it moves only that part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of it with which it comes in contact. A bullet thrown
with but little force against a window will crack a whole
pane of glass; but if shot from a pistol it merely makes
a round hole. So, also, a cannon-ball having a great velocity
may pass through the side of a ship, doing perhaps
comparatively little damage, while one moving with much
less velocity may do vastly more damage by splintering
the wood to a considerable extent. For the same reason
a rapid ball hitting a person may occasion less suffering
and do less harm than a slow ball; for a rapid ball kills
merely the parts which it touches, leaving the flesh around
in a sound state, while the slow ball bruises over a large
space. If a large pitcher filled with some heavy liquid
be quickly taken up the handle will break, leaving the
pitcher behind. Large dishes are often broken in this
way when heavily loaded.</p>

<p><a name="P_184" id="P_184"></a>
184. <b>Inertia Shown in the Disposition of Motion to
Continue.</b>&mdash;Of this I will cite some illustrations. As in
the case of the ship, in the first illustration in § 183, it
takes time to communicate motion to the whole ship, or,
in other words, to overcome its inertia, so when the ship
is once in rapid motion it does not stop suddenly when
the sails are taken down, but its inertia tending to keep
it moving is gradually overcome by the resistance of the
water. If one be standing up in a carriage in motion,
and the horses suddenly stop, he will be thrown forward,
for his body has a motion in common with the carriage,
and from inertia is disposed to go on when the carriage
stops. When you strike your foot against any thing to
get the snow off, you give the foot and the snow a common
motion together, then arresting the motion of the
foot, the snow from inertia passes on. The same thing
is illustrated in striking a book against any thing to get
the dust off. If a ship strike upon a rock every thing on
board which is loose is dashed forward. The earth as it
revolves on its axis has a velocity at the equator of about
1000 miles an hour. If this revolution should be sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>ly
arrested every thing loose on its surface, having acquired
the motion of the earth, would be at once thrown
eastward, just as the furniture, etc., on board ship are
dashed forward when it is stopped by running against
a rock. All the houses, and monuments, and structures
of every kind would fall prostrate eastward. All the
cities on our Atlantic coast would be plunged into the
ocean; and while the waters would leave the western
shores of the Atlantic, they would overflow its eastern
shores, and deluge the continent of Europe, as water in
a vessel on board a ship that had struck an obstacle
would be thrown forward over its side.</p>

185. <b>An Equestrian Feat.</b>&mdash;In the feat represented in
Fig. 127 the only
exertion made by
the rider is to raise
himself sufficiently
to pass over the
cord, and he comes
down again upon
the horse's back,
simply because of the motion which he has in common
with the horse, his feet going in the path represented by
the dotted line. If he should attempt to throw himself
forward, as in leaping from the ground, he would go too
far, and perhaps strike upon the horse's neck instead of
his back. Skill in jumping from a moving carriage consists
in making proper allowance for the forward motion
which is had in common with the carriage. Most persons
are apt to overdo the matter, and so come to the
ground prostrate, and with more violence than is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="P_186" id="P_186"></a>
186. <b>A Case in Court.</b>&mdash;A dashing young man driving
a light phaeton ran against a heavy carriage. His father
was induced by his son's representations to prosecute
the driver of the carriage for driving too fast. A knowledge
of motal inertia very readily decided the case. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
son and his servant both declared that the shock of the
carriage was so great against the phaeton that they were
thrown over the horses' heads. They thus proved themselves
guilty of the fast driving, for it was their own
rapid motion that threw them out when the phaeton was
stopped by running against the carriage. The following
case is a parallel one. If two boats, the one of large size
sailing slowly up stream, the other a small one sailing
rapidly down, run against each other, a man standing in
the bow of the one going down will be thrown much
farther forward than one standing in the bow of the
other.</p>

<p><a name="P_187" id="P_187"></a>
187. <b>Course of Bodies Thrown into the Air.</b>&mdash;It results
from the principle that I have illustrated that when any
body, as a stone, is thrown, as we say, straight upward,
it does not, in reality, go up or come down perpendicularly.
If it did it would come down at a great distance
from us. Suppose it takes two seconds for it to go up
and to reach the ground. If we are at the equator, in that
two seconds we move from the point where we threw
up the stone nearly 3000 feet eastward, and therefore if
the stone rose and fell perpendicularly it would fall 3000
feet westward of us. Why, instead of this, does it fall
at our feet? Because that when thrown into the air it
has not only the upward motion given by the hand, but
also the forward motion of the earth. It is a case similar
to that of the rider in Fig. 127, the horse representing
the surface of the earth and the rider the stone. For
the same reason a man on board of a steamboat, though
it move fifteen miles an hour, tosses up his ball or orange
and catches it as well as if he were on land. This he
could not do if both he and his orange did not have the
same forward motion that the boat does. So, also, if a
man fall from a mast-head he reaches the deck at the
foot of the mast when the vessel is sailing rapidly, just
as he would if it were lying still at the wharf. If he did
not by inertia retain the forward motion which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in common with the vessel he would fall at some distance
behind the mast.</p>

188. <b>The Earth and the Atmosphere.</b>&mdash;The air being
held to the earth by attraction, § 151, it has a motion in
common with the earth. It revolves with the earth just
as the tire of a wheel revolves with the wheel. This being
so, our winds are nothing but slight variations of this
constant rapid whirl of the aerial coating of the earth.
If the atmosphere were suddenly to stop whirling round
with the earth we should move through it with a velocity
of 1500 feet a second; and the destructive effect upon
us would be the same as it would were the earth standing
still while the air moved over its surface with this
fearful velocity. A wise man, not reflecting that the atmosphere
moved with the earth, proposed rising in a
balloon, and waiting till the country to which he wished
to go should be passing under him.</p>

<p><a name="P_189" id="P_189"></a>
189. <b>Motion and Rest.</b>&mdash;Though we use the term rest
in opposition to motion, it is obvious from some of the
illustrations given that rest is merely a relative term, for
not a particle of matter in the universe is at rest. Though
when we are sitting still we call ourselves at rest, we are
moving every hour, by the revolution of the earth on its
axis, 1000 miles eastward, and 68,000 miles in our annual
journey round the sun. Why, then, are we so insensible
to these rapid motions? It is partly because the motions
are so uniform, but chiefly because all things around
us, our houses, trees, and even the atmosphere, are moving
along with us. If we were moving along alone, even
at a slow rate, while all these objects were standing still,
we should be conscious of our motion, as we are when,
as we ride along in a carriage, we see the objects at the
road-side not moving along with us.</p>

<p><a name="P_190" id="P_190"></a>
190. <b>A Comparison.</b>&mdash;The above can be made more
clear and impressive by a familiar comparison. A man
on board of a steamboat, by confining his attention to
things within the boat, may, after a while, be almost un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>conscious
of the boat's moving, if the water be smooth,
though the boat may be going at the rate of fifteen miles
an hour. If he be reading in the cabin he will think as
little of his motion as he would were he reading in his
parlor at home. If he should be blindfolded, and turned
around a few times, it would be impossible for him to
tell the direction in which the boat is going. Now it is
with a man on the earth as it is with the man in the
boat. He is unconscious of the motion of the earth for
the same reason that the man in the boat is unconscious
of the boat's motion. All objects around him are moving
along with him, as the objects around the man in the
cabin of the boat are moving along with him. We can
carry the parallel farther. While the man sits in the
cabin he knows not how fast the boat moves, nor even
whether it moves at all. He must look out to decide
this, and even then he may not be able to tell whether
the boat moves, or whether he merely sees the water
running by it. We often are actually deceived in this
respect. A steamboat struggling against wind and wave
may appear to those on board to be advancing when it
is really stationary, or even when it is losing ground.
So when we look at the sun we know not whether it is
the sun or the earth that is moving. Mere vision, without
reasoning on the subject, leads one to think that it
is the sun that moves. For the same reason, if a child
should be placed in a carriage for the first time without
seeing the horses, but with its eyes fixed on objects at
the road-side, he would probably think that all the fences
and trees and rocks and houses are in motion.</p>

<p><a name="P_191" id="P_191"></a>
191. <b>Absolute and Relative Motion.</b>&mdash;The motion of a
body is said to be <em>absolute</em> when it is considered without
relation to the position of any other body. Its motion
is said to be <em>relative</em> when it is moving with respect to
some other body. Absolute rest is unknown, for no body
in the universe is known to be without motion. But a
body may be relatively at rest, that is, in a fixed relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
position to other bodies. Every body is in a state of
absolute motion, and yet it may be in a state of relative
rest. All objects that appear to us to be at rest have a
very rapid absolute motion. They appear to be at rest
merely because they have the same rapidity and direction
of absolute motion that we have ourselves. And
all the motions which are apparent to the eye are only
slight differences in the common absolute motions, of
which, though they are so exceedingly rapid, we are entirely
unconscious. Thus, if I stand still, and another at
my side walks at the rate of three miles an hour eastward,
we both of us have a common absolute motion of 1000
miles in every hour, and he merely adds three miles to
his thousand&mdash;I move 1000 miles, and he 1003. So if I
sit still in my parlor, and my friend travels eastward at
the rate of 20 miles an hour, I move every hour 1000
miles, and he 1020. And if he travel westward at this
rate he really travels slower than I do&mdash;he has an absolute
motion eastward of 980 miles, and I of 1000. At
the same time we are both whirling on in our annual
journey around the sun at the rate of 68,000 miles an
hour.</p>

192. <b>Obstacles to Motion.</b>&mdash;As motion is naturally disposed
to continue (§ 49 and § 184), whenever it is stopped
it does not spend itself, but is stopped by obstacles. The
principal of these obstacles are: gravitation; the resistance
of opposing substances&mdash;solids, liquids, and gases;
and friction. When a stone is thrown into the air its
upward motion is gradually destroyed by the attraction
of the earth and the resistance of the air. Observe, now,
why it descends. It is from the action of one of the
causes which arrested its upward flight&mdash;the attraction
of the earth. In its descent it is retarded by the resistance
of the air, as it was in its ascent. This retardation
is very obvious in the case of substances which present
a large surface to the air, as a feather. A small piece of
lead will outweigh many feathers, and therefore, as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
quantity of matter is so much greater in proportion to
its surface than that of a feather, it will fall to the ground
much more quickly. That this is owing wholly to the
resistance of the air can be proved with the air-pump.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p>Suppose that you have a tall receiver, Fig.
128, on the air-pump, and a piece of lead and
a feather are placed at its upper part in such
a way that they can be made to fall at the
same instant. Exhaust the air, and then let
them fall. They will go down side by side,
as represented by the figure, and reach the
bottom of the receiver at the same time, because
there is no air there to resist the progress
of the feather. The toy called the water-hammer
illustrates the same thing. When
water falls through the air the resistance of
the air tends to separate its particles, as we
see in the falling of water thrown up by a
fountain. In the water-hammer, which is a
closed tube containing a little water and no
air, when the water is made to fall from one
end to the other, as there is no air to divide
it, it falls as one mass, and gives a sharp sound
like the blow of a hammer. An instrument
essentially like this can be made with a thin
glass flask. Put a little water in it, and, after
heating it to boiling over a spirit-lamp, cork
the flask tightly, and then leave the water to cool. As
all the space above the water was filled with steam when
the flask was corked, it is a vacuum now that the steam
is condensed.</p>

<p><a name="P_193" id="P_193"></a>
193. <b>Relation of Bulk to the Resistance of Liquids and
Gases.</b>&mdash;You have already seen, in § 192, that the more
surface a body has in proportion to its weight the greater
is the resistance of the air to its motion. This truth,
which applies to liquids as well as to airs or gaseous substances,
explains the fact that small bodies meet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
proportionately more resistance than large ones. The
body B, Fig. 129, you see is made up
of eight cubes of the size of the cube
<em>a</em>, that is, it has eight times the quantity
of matter that <em>a</em> has. Now if B
were moving through air or water, any
of its sides pushing the water before
it would meet with only four times the
resistance that a side of <em>a</em> would, for its surface is only
four times as large, and yet the body is eight times as
large as <em>a</em>. And the greater the difference of size the
greater is the difference of resistance. If B were a cube
twenty-seven times as large as <em>a</em> it would meet with only
nine times as much resistance. You see here the reason
that shells and cannon-balls can be thrown much farther
than bullets and small shot. The sportsman does not
throw away his shot by foolishly aiming at birds at great
distances, and yet shells and large cannon-balls can be
thrown the distance of several miles. The difference is
not in the degree of velocity which the powder produces,
but in the resistance of the air. It is for the same reason
that rain falls with greater rapidity than drizzling
mist.</p>

</div>

<p>As liquids and aeriform substances resist solids in motion
in proportion to the amount of surface which the
solids present to them, so also when they strike against
solids they cause motion in them in proportion to the
amount of surface acted upon. Thus a violent wind
could not move a lump of tin, but could blow along a
sheet of it, or tear up a roofing of it if it got beneath.
So clouds of sand are raised into the air in the deserts
of Africa, although the particles are of the same material
as stones, and therefore have the same specific gravity.
For the same reason dust, feathers, the down and pollen
of flowers, etc., are blown about, although they are heavier
than the air. A pebble is moved more easily by a
current of water than a stone, because it has a larger sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>face,
in proportion to its weight, to be acted upon by the
water. For the same reason sand is moved more easily
than pebbles, and fine mud than sand, though stones,
pebbles, sand, and mud may all be of the same material.
This explains why you will find mud where the current
is slow, sand where it is faster, pebbles and stones where
it is still faster, and where the current is exceedingly
rapid you find nothing but large rocks&mdash;sand, pebbles,
and stones not being able to resist its force. For the
same reason, in the process of winnowing, the chaff is
carried away by the wind; while the grain, presenting
less surface in proportion to its weight to be acted upon
by the air, falls to the floor.</p>

<p>In all the above cases the moving water or air may be
considered as acting in opposition to the attraction of
the earth, the latter pulling the substance down to the
earth, and the former pushing it away from the earth.
Of course, the more surface the water or air has to push
upon the greater is the effect; and it is to be remembered
that the attraction of gravity is as the quantity of
matter, without any regard to amount of surface in the
body attracted.</p>

194. <b>Relation of Force to Velocity.</b>&mdash;It would seem
at first thought that the motion produced in any body
must be in exact proportion to the force producing it;
that is, that twice the force which produces a given velocity
would double that velocity, and three times would
treble it, etc. This is true where there are no obstacles
to motion, as in the case of the heavenly bodies moving
in their orbits. But in all motions here upon the earth
there are obstacles; and as reaction is always equal to
action, the greater the velocity the greater is the reaction
of the obstacle. If, therefore, you increase the velocity
of any body, you not only have to communicate
more motion to it, but you must overcome also the increased
reaction. The rate of increase of force for increased
velocities has been very accurately ascertained.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
This I will explain. A boat moving from B to A, Fig.
130, we will suppose, displaces a quantity of water represented
by the space between the two lines extending
from B to A. Now if it move from B to C, it displaces
twice the bulk of water B C; and as it is displaced in the
same time that B A was, each particle is displaced with
twice the velocity. Double the force is required to displace
a double portion of water, and to do this with
double the velocity the force must be doubled again.
So if the boat is made to move three times as far in the
same time, that is from B to D, three times the quantity
of water is displaced, and each of these three portions,
B A, A C, and C D, is displaced with three times the velocity.
The force required, then, to do this is nine times
that required to carry the boat from B to A in the same
time. It is plain, therefore, that with velocities represented
by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the forces requisite
to produce these velocities must be as the squares of
these numbers; viz., 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. This law is a very
important one in a practical point of view. For example,
it shows us how much larger a quantity of coal is
required to produce in steamboats a high velocity than
a moderate one. Its application too to the science of
gunnery is important.</p>

<p><a name="P_195" id="P_195"></a>
195. <b>Relation of Shape to Velocity.</b>&mdash;The resistance
of air or water to a flat surface is greater than to a convex
one, because the latter readily turns the particles to
the one side and the other. So, also, a concave surface
is resisted much more than a flat one, because the particles
of the air or water can not so easily escape sideways.
Fishes are of a spindle-like and slender shape, that they
may have as little resistance as possible from the water.
It is for this reason that a fish has no neck, for if it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
one the upper portion of its body would, from the resistance
of the water striking against it, prove a serious impediment
to rapidity of motion. Mankind have in some
measure imitated the shape of fishes in their boats and
ships. Boats which are intended to bear light burdens
and go swiftly are made very long and narrow. The
webbed feet of water-fowls, when they are moved forward,
are folded up so as to meet with as little resistance
as possible; but when they are moved backward they
are spread out so as to press against the water a broad
concave surface. For the same reason the wings of a
bird are made convex upward and concave downward;
and when it moves its wing upward it makes it cut the
air somewhat edgewise, but in moving it downward it
presses directly with the whole concave surface.</p>

<p><a name="P_196" id="P_196"></a>
196. <b>Friction.</b>&mdash;Friction is generally an obstacle to
motion. When we roll a ball, the more rough is the
surface on which we roll it the greater is the friction and
the sooner is the ball stopped. Friction lessens the rapidity
of motion in machinery, and to prevent this as far
as possible oiling and other expedients are employed.
But sometimes friction is a cause of motion, as, for example,
the friction of the driving-wheels of a locomotive
upon the rails. In this case the wheel pushes backward
on the rail at each successive point of contact. To make
this clear, suppose a common wheel is deprived of its
rim and is made to revolve on the ends of its spokes.
The end of each spoke gives a backward push as it strikes
the ground. Now the rim of a wheel makes the same
pushes, but they are more numerous&mdash;they are continuous,
being made by all the successive points in the rim.
Sometimes the rails of a railroad are too smooth from
frost or some other cause, and then sand is thrown upon
them to give the locomotive a start. The sand serves to
prevent the wheels from sliding by enabling them to get
some hold upon the rails in their backward pushes.</p>

197. <b>Friction of Liquids in Tubes.</b>&mdash;So easily does wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>ter
flow along that we should not at first view suppose
that it would be delayed much from friction as it passes
through pipes or along channels. But the retarding influence
is considerable. An inch tube 200 feet long,
lying horizontally connected with a reservoir, will discharge
water not one quarter as fast as an inch orifice in
the side of the reservoir. Sudden turns in a pipe should
be avoided, because they occasion so much friction against
the sides of the pipe and among the particles of water by
disturbing the regularity of the current. In the entrance
of the arteries into the brain, in order to prevent the
blood from flowing too rapidly into this organ, there are
sudden turns in the arteries to retard the blood; and in
grazing animals, as there is special danger that the blood
will flow too freely to the brain as the head is held down
in eating, there is a special provision to prevent this in a
net-work of arteries. If the arteries of the brain in such
animals were straight tubes they would continually be
dying of congestion of the brain or of apoplexy.</p>

<div class="figright">

<div class="caption">
Fig. 131.</div>
</div>

<p>Friction in a small pipe is greater in proportion to its
size than in a large pipe. In a pipe an inch in diameter
water will not move more than one-fifth as fast as in a
tube two inches in diameter. This may be made clear
by Fig. 131, in which is represented
the area of a small tube inside of the
area of a tube of twice its diameter.
Suppose the effect of the friction in
the large tube to extend in to <em>a</em>. In
the small one it will extend in as far,
that is, to <em>b</em>. But <em>e a</em> is about five
times as long as <em>e b</em>, so that there is
full five times as much water clear of
friction in the large tube as there is in the smaller one.</p>

<p><a name="P_198" id="P_198"></a>
198. <b>Friction in Streams.</b>&mdash;The retarding effect of friction
is very obvious in brooks and rivers. The water in
the middle of a stream runs much more rapidly than it
does near its banks. When a river is very shallow at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
its sides the water there scarcely moves, though in the
middle the water may be running at a rapid rate. A
tide, therefore, flowing up a river, moves more freely
near its banks than it does in the middle of the stream,
because it meets with less resistance there from the
downward current. Water moves less rapidly at the
bottom of a river than it does at the surface. For this
reason, if a stick be so loaded at one end as to stand upright
in water, in the current of a river its upper end
will be carried along faster than
its lower end, and therefore it
will incline forward, as in Fig.
132. As the sea rolls in over a
beach, each wave at length pours
over its crest and breaks, because
the lower part of the wave
is retarded by friction on the
beach. Were it not for the constant retardation of friction
at the sides and bottom of rivers, and at their bends,
those rivers which have their rise at a considerable height
above the level of the sea would acquire an immense velocity.
Thus the Rhone, drawing its waters from 1000
feet above the level of the ocean, would pour them forth
with the velocity of water which had fallen perpendicularly
the same height, that is, at the rate of 170 miles an
hour, did not friction continually diminish the velocity.</p>

<p><a name="P_199" id="P_199"></a>
199. <b>Waves.</b>&mdash;Waves are generally formed by the
friction of air upon water. Observe how they are formed.
As soon as any portion of water is raised above the
general surface it tends by gravity to fall to a level with
the water around it, and in doing so the portion next to
it is forced upward, forming another wave; and so one
wave produces another, each one being smaller than the
preceding, till at length the motion is wholly lost. This
is always the process when the cause of the motion is a
single impulse, as when a stone is dropped into the water.
But when the waves are produced by a succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of impulses, as when wind makes them, they are mostly
of the same size. It is quite a common notion that the
water moves as rapidly as the waves appear to do; but
the water really remains nearly stationary, rising and falling,
while merely the form of the wave advances. The
same wave is made up continually of a succession of different
portions of water, or rather it is a succession of
different waves. This is very well illustrated by the
waving of a rope or carpet. In an open sea a wave slopes
regularly on either side; but when it comes near the
shore, for the reason given in § 198, it grows more and
more nearly perpendicular on the side toward the shore,
till at length it falls over, and if it be very large the roar
thus caused by its breaking is heard to a great distance.</p>

<p><a name="P_200" id="P_200"></a>
200. <b>Height of Waves.</b>&mdash;"So awful," says Dr. Arnot,
"is the spectacle of a storm at sea that it is generally
viewed through a medium which biases the judgment;
and lofty as waves really are, imagination pictures them
loftier still. Now no wave rises more than ten feet above
the ordinary sea-level, which, with the ten feet that its
surface afterward descends below this, gives twenty feet
for the whole height from the bottom of any water-valley
to an adjoining summit. This proposition is easily
verified by a person who tries at what height on a ship's
mast the horizon remains always in sight over the top
of the waves&mdash;allowance being made for accidental inclinations
of the vessel, and for her sinking in the water
to much below her water-line, at the time when she
reaches the bottom of the hollow between two waves.
The spray of the sea, driven along by the violence of the
wind, is of course much higher than the summit of the
liquid wave; and a wave, coming against an obstacle,
may dash to a great elevation above it. At the Eddystone
Light-house, when a surge breaks which has been
growing under a storm all the way across the Atlantic,
it dashes even over the lantern at the summit."</p>

<p><a name="P_201" id="P_201"></a>
201. <b>Momentum.</b>&mdash;The momentum of a body is its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
force when in motion. In estimating the momentum of
any body two things must be considered&mdash;its velocity,
and its quantity of matter or weight. A bullet fired
from a gun has a vastly greater force, or power of overcoming
obstacles, than one thrown by the hand, from its
greater velocity. Now suppose the weight or quantity
of matter to be increased ten times, and that it moves
with the same velocity as before, it will have ten times
as much force as before, and will overcome ten times as
great an obstacle. For this reason a small stone dropping
upon a man's head may do but little harm, while
one ten times as large, falling from the same height, may
stun and perhaps kill him. But if the large stone could
fall with only one-tenth of the velocity of the small one,
the effect of both would be the same. Let this example
illustrate the rule for calculating the momentum of moving
bodies, viz., multiply the quantity of matter into the
velocity: Let the weight of the small stone be 1 ounce,
and that of the large one 10 ounces. If they fall from
a height of 16 feet the force with which the large one
will strike will be expressed by 160 (16×10), that of the
small one by 16 (1×16). Suppose, now, that by some
force in addition to gravity the small one could be made
to move ten times as fast as the large one, the force with
which it would strike would be equal to that of the large
one, and would be expressed by the number 160.</p>

<div class="caption">
Fig. 133.</div>
</div>

<p>I will illustrate this in another way. Let <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, Fig.
133, be two balls of clay of equal
size hanging over a graduated
arc. Now if <em>b</em> be let fall from
the top of the arc, 6, on striking
against <em>a</em> it gives half of its motion
to <em>a</em>, and they both move
on together. But how far will
they go? To 3, on the other
side of the arc. Why? Let the
quantity of matter in each ball be called 1, and the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>tion
of <em>b</em> 6. The momentum will therefore be 6. Now
the momentum of the two together will be the same
after the blow as that of <em>b</em> was before it. But the quantity
of matter is twice as great, and must be called 2.
Therefore the motion must be represented as 3, to make
the momentum 6 (2×3). But suppose that <em>b</em> is twice as
large as <em>a</em>. Falling from 6, its momentum would be represented
by 12 (2×6). After it has struck <em>a</em>, the momentum
of the two together would be the same as that of <em>b</em>
before the stroke; but the quantity being 3, the motion
would be represented by 4. They would therefore move
to 4 on the arc.</p>

202. <b>Examples.</b>&mdash;A few examples illustrating momentum
as being compounded of quantity of matter and velocity
will suffice. If a musket-ball of an ounce weight
were so much spent as to move with only a velocity of a
foot in a second, its force would be so small that if it hit
any one it would do no harm. But a cannon-ball weighing
a thousand ounces moving at this slow rate would
have a very great force&mdash;equal, in fact, to the momentum
of an ounce ball moving 1000 feet in a second.&mdash;If a
plank push a man's foot against a wharf he will scarcely
feel it; but if the plank, instead of being alone, is one of
a thousand planks fastened together in a raft, and the
whole move with the same velocity, the force will be increased
a thousand-fold, and the plank will crush the
foot. So, also, if the one plank when alone should move
a thousand times as fast as the whole raft, the same result
would follow.&mdash;So soft a substance as a candle can
be fired through a board from the momentum given to
it by an immense velocity.&mdash;Perhaps there is no better
example of the great force given to a substance by an
enormous velocity than we have in the wind. So light
a thing is air that people think of it as almost nothing.
But let it be set in rapid motion, and the velocity gives
to it a force, a momentum, which will drive ships upon
the shore, throw over buildings, and tear up trees by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
roots. In this last example we see beautifully illustrated
the meaning of the expression quantity of motion.
In the moving air each particle does its share of the
work in the destructive effects mentioned. Each particle,
therefore, may be considered as a <em>reservoir</em> of motion,
and the quantity of motion in any case depends
upon the quantity which each particle has and the number
of the particles.</p>

203. <b>Production of Great Velocities.</b>&mdash;When there are
no obstacles to motion great velocities may be produced
by a single impulse. Thus at the beginning the Creator
gave a single impulse to each of the heavenly bodies,
producing enormous velocities, which continue unaltered
year after year and age after age, because these bodies
fly in their orbits through space where there is no resistance
of any thing like air to retard the motion. But
in all the motions that we see around us there are obstacles
continually retarding them; and therefore no very
rapid motion is produced by any single impulse, but a
succession of impulses is required to accumulate sufficient
momentum so to overcome the obstacles as to secure
a great velocity. I will give a few examples in illustration.
One of the best examples we have in the fall
of bodies to the earth. You know that the greater the
elevation from which a body falls the greater is its velocity,
and therefore the greater the force with which it
strikes. Why is this? If it fell because of a single impulse
making it go toward the earth, this would not be
the case, and if there were no air in the way the velocity
would be uniform; but the resistance of the air would
retard the velocity, so that if a number of bodies should
receive the same impulse at different elevations, the one
the farthest off would be the most retarded, and therefore
come down slower than all the rest. In this case,
the higher the elevation from which a man should fall
the less would be the injury. But a body does not come
to the ground by a single impulse, but by a succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of impulses, or rather a continued impulse. Every moment
that the body is coming down it is drawn upon by
the attraction of the earth, and this continued action of
the cause of the motion makes it continually increase in
rapidity. It is on the same principle of continued action
that a man lifts his hammer high when he wishes to
inflict a heavy blow. In this case both gravitation and
the muscular power of the arm exert their force on the
hammer through the whole space. A horse in kicking
does the same thing, and by the great length of the leg
the velocity given to the foot by this continued action of
the muscles is very great. An arrow is not shot by a
single momentary impulse of the bow-string, but the
string, by following it through a considerable space,
gives it a continued impulse. The action of gunpowder
upon a bullet issuing from a gun is apparently an instantaneous
and single impulse, but it is not really so. The
great velocity given to the bullet is given to it by the
continued impulse of the expansive force of gases produced
from the powder, and it therefore depends much
on the length of the barrel. If this be short, the force
of the powder is not confined long enough to the bullet
to give it a great velocity.</p>

<p><a name="P_204" id="P_204"></a>
204. <b>Arrest of Great Velocities.</b>&mdash;As a continued force
is required to produce great velocities, so a continued
resistance is necessary to arrest them. It is by the gradual
or continued resistance of the air that the motion of
a cannon-ball is destroyed. Now if instead of this gradual
resistance any hard substance, as a block of granite,
were opposed to the progress of the ball, it would be at
once broken asunder. We see then the reason that a
hard substance of moderate thickness does not offer so
effectual a resistance to a body moving very rapidly as
some substance of a more yielding kind and of greater
bulk. For example, a bale of cotton will arrest a ball
which would pass through a plank, for the cotton yielding
easily permits the force of the ball to be felt and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>sisted
by a larger bulk, while the wood, not yielding,
opposes but a small portion of its whole bulk to the force
of the ball, and therefore does not arrest it; in other
words, the momentum of the ball is communicated to a
much larger quantity of matter in the cotton than in the
wood. These principles afford a ready explanation of a
feat which is sometimes performed. A man lies upon
his back, and, having an anvil carefully placed upon his
chest, allows some one to strike a heavy blow with a
hammer upon the anvil, and no injury is received. Why?
Because the momentum or force of the hammer is diffused
throughout the bulk of the anvil, and then again
through the bulk of the yielding chest. The man takes
good care to have his lungs well filled with air at the
moment of the blow, for this increases the bulk and elasticity
of the chest, and thus promotes the diffusion of the
momentum. If the blow of the hammer were received
directly upon the chest great injury would be done, for
the force would now be spent upon one small spot alone.&mdash;The
principles above elucidated are applied by men instinctively
in their common labors and efforts. You see
a man catching bricks that are tossed to him. As he
receives the bricks into his hands he lets his hands and
the bricks move together a little way, so that he may
gradually arrest the motion of the bricks. To do it suddenly
would give him a painful lesson on momentum.
So when a man jumps from a height he does not come
to the ground in a straight position. This would cause
a sudden and therefore a painful arrest of the motion of
the whole body. To avoid this he comes to his feet with
all the great joints of his body bent, so that the different
portions approach the ground successively, his head having
its motion arrested last.</p>

205. <b>Communication of Motion in Elastic Bodies.</b>&mdash;Momentum
is transferred from one body to another very
differently in elastic from what it is in non-elastic bodies.
As you saw in § 201, when one non-elastic body strikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
upon another the momentum is divided between them,
and both move on together. Now if <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, Fig. 133,
were elastic bodies, as ivory balls, and <em>b</em> should be let
fall against <em>a</em>, it would give all its momentum to <em>a</em>.
Therefore <em>b</em> would stop, and <em>a</em> would move on to the
same height from which <em>b</em> came. The reason is, that
the velocity lost by <em>b</em> and received by <em>a</em> is just double
what it would be if the balls were non-elastic. For the
same reason, if <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, being elastic, meet each other
from equal heights on the arc, they will both rebound,
and return to the same heights from which they came.
But <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'if non elastic'">if non-elastic</ins> they simply destroy each other's momentum
and stop. The effect produced in the former
case is just twice as great as in the latter, as you may
see by reckoning on the arc. For the same reason, too,
if you have a row of elastic balls,
as in Fig. 134, and let <em>a</em> fall from
the point <em>i</em> upon <em>b</em>, it will stop
there; and communicating all its
momentum to <em>b</em>, this momentum
will pass from <em>b</em> to <em>c</em>, and so on
through all the row of balls to <em>e</em>,
the last one, which will fly off to the point <em>h</em>, at the same
height with <em>i</em>, the point from which <em>a</em> fell. If <em>b</em> be held
still, and <em>a</em> be let fall upon it, <em>a</em> will rebound to the height
from which it fell, for then the compressed elastic spring
(§ 39) of each ball, as <em>b</em> is immovable, communicates all
the motion to <em>a</em>. It is for this reason that an elastic ball,
on being thrown against any thing fixed, rebounds. If
what it is thrown against be perfectly elastic it rebounds
with a force equal to that with which it is thrown.</p>

206. <b>Reflection of Motion.</b>&mdash;If an elastic body be
thrown perpendicularly upon a surface it rebounds in
the same path in which it is thrown. But if it hit the
surface obliquely it is thrown off or reflected in a different
direction. Thus a ball thrown from <em>b</em> upon <em>c</em>, Fig.
135 (p. 158), will return in the line drawn to <em>b</em>. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
it be thrown from <em>d</em> it will be reflected in
the line <em>c a</em>. Now the angle <em>d c b</em>, called
the angle of incidence, is always equal to
<em>b c a</em>, the angle of reflection. The same,
you will find in other parts of this book, is
true of sound and light and heat.</p>

<p><a name="P_207" id="P_207"></a>
207. <b>Uniformity of Motion.</b>&mdash;Since motion,
when once begun, is disposed to continue unless arrested
by obstacles, it is naturally uniform both in its velocity
and its direction. I will speak now only of velocity.
Suppose a body to be set in motion, and to meet with no
opposition from friction, or the resistance of air, or attraction,
it would move on forever, and with the same velocity
with which it began. Now precisely these circumstances
we have in the motion of the heavenly bodies in
their orbits. They are, it is true, under the influence of
attraction, but in such a way, as you will soon see, as not
to interfere with the uniformity of their motion. Were
it not for this uniformity we should have no regularity
of times and seasons. It is only by the uniform motion
of the earth round the sun, and round its own axis, that
we can calculate for to-morrow, or next week, or next
year. If these motions were irregular it would throw
confusion into all our calculations for the future and all
our recollections of the past. We can measure time by
nothing else but regular motion, and were there no regular
motion we should have merely the very inaccurate
measure furnished by our sensations. To measure time
with accuracy we take some great and extensive uniform
motion as our standard. Thus, the revolution of the
earth around the sun we take as one division of time,
and call it a year. We observe that during this time it
whirls around on its own axis 365 times, and the time
occupied by each of these revolutions we call a day.</p>

<p><a name="P_208" id="P_208"></a>
208. <b>The Pendulum.</b>&mdash;Various modes of measuring
time have been adopted by mankind. At first time was
inaccurately divided by merely observing the sun. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
after a while man resorted to various contrivances to
measure short periods of time with accuracy. All of
these depend upon the uniformity of motion alone. The
sun-dial measures time by the uniform movement of the
shadow on its face, caused by the uniform movement of
the earth in relation to the sun. The hour-glass measures
time by the uniform fall of sand produced by the
attraction of gravity. The best measurement of time is
by the comparatively modern invention of clocks and
watches, in which time is divided into very minute periods
by the uniform motion of the pendulum or the balance-wheel.
The pendulum furnishes an interesting example
of motion kept up by the influence of gravity. It
was not till the time of Galileo, less than three centuries
ago, that its operation was understood and appropriated
to the measurement of time. He observed that chandeliers
hanging from lofty ceilings vibrated very long and
uniformly after they were accidentally agitated, and the
thought of the philosopher evolved from this phenomenon
the most important results. Though it had been
before men's eyes in some shape or other since the creation,
it was reserved for Galileo to observe its significance,
and the result is that the pendulum has become
man's time-keeper over the whole earth.</p>

209. <b>Explanation of its Operation.</b>&mdash;A pendulum consists
commonly of a ball or weight at the end of a rod
suspended so as to vibrate with little friction at the
point of the suspension. Let
<em>a b</em>, Fig. 136, represent such
a pendulum. When it is at
rest it makes a plumb-line
hanging toward the centre
of the earth. If it be raised
to <em>c</em> and be left to fall, the
force of gravity will not only
carry it to <em>b</em>, but, by the accelerated
velocity or accu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>mulated
momentum which it gives it in its descent, it
will carry it to <em>d</em>. The same would be true of its return
from <em>d</em>. And it would vibrate forever in this way if it
could be entirely freed from the resistance of the air and
friction. But, as it is, the pendulum left to itself gradually
loses its motion from these obstacles. In the common
clock the office of the weight is to counteract the
influence of these obstacles, and keep the pendulum vibrating.
In the watch the mainspring performs the same
office to the balance-wheel.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>The times of the vibrations of a pendulum are nearly
equal whether the arc it describes be great or small.
For when the vibration is a
large one the velocity which
the pendulum acquires in falling
is greater than when the
vibration is of small extent.
The reason is that the higher
it rises the more steep is the
beginning of its descent. Thus
<em>a c</em>, Fig. 137, is steeper than <em>c b</em>.</p>

210. <b>Gridiron Pendulum.</b>&mdash;The longer a pendulum is
the longer time does its vibration occupy. It requires a
pendulum of the length of a little over thirty-nine inches
to vibrate seconds. Cold weather, by contracting the
pendulum, makes it vibrate quicker than in summer,
and so makes the clock go faster. Various
contrivances have been resorted to in order to
counteract the variation of length in pendulums
by heat and cold, but what is called the gridiron
pendulum is the best. In this pendulum an ingenious
use is made of the fact that heat expands
brass nearly twice as much as it does steel. A
simple form of this pendulum is given in Fig. 138.
The middle rod is made of brass, and the side
rods, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, of steel. Suppose that the brass
rod expands or increases in length half an inch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
The rod <em>c</em> would be drawn upward by it, and the rod <em>b</em>
downward, each one quarter of an inch; but
this effect is counteracted by the expansion of
each steel rod, which is half that of the brass,
that is, one quarter of an inch. The ball <em>d</em>, therefore,
always retains the same distance from the
point of suspension, <em>e</em>. In Fig. 139 you have a
gridiron pendulum of a more compound character,
a part of the bars being steel, and a part
brass.</p>

<p><a name="P_211" id="P_211"></a>
211. <b>Motion Disposed to be Straight.</b>&mdash;When
a body is set in motion, if it be left to itself&mdash;that
is, if nothing interfere with its motion&mdash;it
will move in a perfectly straight line. It requires
some interference from some force to bend
the motion. You will readily see from the views
which I have given you that there never is any
motion that is, strictly speaking, straight, because
every motion is in some measure compound; that
is, each cause of motion is modified in its action by other
causes of motion. But we can approximate very nearly
to straight motion by making one cause preponderate
very much over other causes. This I will illustrate. If
we fire a bullet horizontally from a gun it is acted upon
by three forces: the propulsive force of the powder, the
resistance of the air, and the attraction of the earth. The
action of the second of these is in direct opposition to
the first, and therefore only retards the motion, and does
not tend at all to turn it from its straight course. This
is seen in the fact that the ball is turned neither to the
right hand nor to the left. But the third force tends to
make the ball bend its course toward the ground. It
does this from the instant that the ball leaves the gun
throughout its flight, but so slightly that practically we
can consider the ball as going straight for short distances.
When we take a long range we must make allowance
for this bending down of the motion. Accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>ingly,
for the sake of precision, a double sight is provided
in modern guns, as seen at A and B, Fig. 140. This you
see secures the pointing of the gun a little above the
level of the object aimed at, that level being indicated
by the dotted line.</p>

<p>The greater is the propulsive force the more nearly to
a straight line is the path of the propelled body. This
may be seen very clearly in
Fig. 141, representing the
issuing of water at different
points from a vessel. As
pressure in a liquid is as
depth, § 121, the force with
which the water is thrust
out is greater at C than at
B, and at D than at C. The
issuing stream, therefore, is
most nearly straight at the
lowest point, D.</p>

<p>The motion of projectiles, thus alluded to, will be
more particularly noticed farther on.</p>

212. <b>Compound Straight Motion.</b>&mdash;We call that motion
compound which is produced by two or more forces
acting upon the body. This may be straight or curved.
I will first speak of the straight. If a man attempt to
row a boat straight across a river, the point which he
will reach will not be directly opposite to that from
which he started, but below. Two forces act upon the
boat: the current tending to carry it straight down the
stream, and his rowing tending to carry it straight across.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
The boat will go in
neither of these directions,
but in a
line between them.
Let A B, Fig. 142,
represent the bank
of the river, from
which he starts at A,
with the bow of the
boat pointing to C,
on the opposite bank. Suppose now that in the time that
it takes him to row across the current would carry him
down to B if he did not row at all. He will in this time,
by the two forces together, reach the point D, opposite
to B, his course being the line A D. So if the wind blow
upon a vessel in such a way as to carry it eastward, and
a current is pushing it southward, the vessel will run in
a middle line, viz., southeast. For the same reason if a
boy kick a foot-ball already in motion, it will not be carried
in the direction in which he kicks it, but in a line
between that direction and the direction in which its former
motion was carrying it. In swimming, flying, rowing,
etc., we have examples of compound motion, the
middle line between the directions of the forces always
being taken by the body moved.</p>

Fig. 144.</div>

<img src="images/illus-164b.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 145.</div>
</div>

<p>If we take Fig. 142, illustrating the movement of the
boat, and draw two
lines, one from A to
C and the other from
B to D, we shall
have the parallelogram
A C D B, Fig.
143, in which the
line A C represents
the force of the rowing,
A B the force
of the current, and A D the path of the boat. You see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
then, that if we wish to find in what direction and how
far in a given time a body acted upon by two forces will
move, we are to draw two lines in the direction of these
forces, and of a length in proportion to the distances to
which they would move it in that time; then by drawing
two lines parallel to these we
shall have a parallelogram,
and the diagonal of this will
represent the distance and the
course of the moving body.
If a body be acted upon by
two equal forces and at right
angles to each other, the figure
described will be a square, as
you see in Fig. 144. If they
vary from being at right angles
to each other the figure will vary in the same proportion
from the
square figure, as
seen in Figs. 145
and 146. In the
three figures A B
and A D represent
the two forces, and
A C the resulting
motion. You observe
by these diagrams
that the nearer the two forces come to being in
the same direction the farther will they move the body.
You see this in the different lengths of the diagonals in
Fig. 144 and Fig. 146. The more nearly, therefore, the
wind coincides with the current the more rapidly will a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
vessel be carried along before the wind. When, on the
other hand, the angle at which two forces act upon a
body is much greater than a right angle, they will propel
it but a small distance. Thus if two forces act on a body
in the directions D A and D C, Fig. 147, they will move
it only the distance represented by the diagonal D B.
This diagram represents the motion of a vessel sailing
almost directly against a current by a wind the force of
which is equal to that of the current, while Fig. 146 represents
the motion of a vessel where wind and current
being of equal force very nearly coincide. In the above
diagrams I have supposed the forces to be equal; but
the same truth can be shown in regard to unequal forces
as seen in Fig. 143.</p>

213. <b>Curved Motion.</b>&mdash;No single impulse can produce
a curved motion. Neither can two or more impulses
communicated at one time. In both of these cases the
motion would be in a straight line. Curved motion may
be produced by two forces, one of which gives it a single
impulse, and the other acts upon it continuously. A
familiar example you have in a ball whirled around at
the end of a string. You can give it an impulse, and
then, holding it in your hand, let it whirl. Here the
impulse you give the ball is one force, and the tension
of the string is the other, the latter acting continuously.
Your hand holding the end of the string is the centre
about which the motion revolves; the impulse which
you have given the ball tends to make it fly away from
the centre in a straight line, and hence is called the <em>centrifugal</em>
force; the tension of the string keeps it from
thus flying off, and so is called the <em>centripetal</em> force.
When the earth, at the creation, was put in motion it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
would have moved in a perfectly straight line, were it
not constantly drawn toward the sun by attraction, the
continuous action of this latter force being the same as
the tension of the string in the case of the whirling ball.
The force of attraction, then, is the centripetal force of
the earth, and the impulse which was given to it by the
Creator in the beginning is its centrifugal force; and,
balanced between these two forces, the earth and all the
heavenly bodies move uniformly onward in their orbits.
The centrifugal force you see in these illustrations is
simply the tendency of motion to a straight line from
the inertia of matter; and this is constantly counteracted
by the centripetal force.</p>

214. <b>Illustrations of Centrifugal Force.</b>&mdash;When a wet
mop is whirled the water flies off in every direction by
its centrifugal force. On the same principle a dog, coming
out of the water, shakes off the water by a semi-rotary
motion.&mdash;When a suspended bucket of water is
turned swiftly around the water rises high on its sides,
and leaves a hollow in the middle. It is the tendency
to fly away from the centre of motion that causes this.&mdash;Large
wheels, revolving with great velocity, have been
broken by the centrifugal force of its particles, and hence
the necessity of having such wheels made very strong.
The immense grindstones used in gun-factories have
sometimes been broken through in the middle, or have
flown into pieces from the same cause.&mdash;A man riding
horseback on turning a sharp corner inclines his body
toward the corner, to avoid being thrown off by the centrifugal
force. So, in the feats of the circus, a man standing
on a horse running at full speed around the ring inclines
his body strongly inward, as you see in Fig. 148
(p. 167). The horse also instinctively inclines in the
same direction for the same reason. If the rider finds
himself in danger of falling, by making the horse go a
little faster, thus adding to the centrifugal force, the difficulty
is relieved.&mdash;The centrifugal force is made use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in milling. The grain is admitted between two circular
stones by a hole in the centre of the upper one, and as
the stone revolves it constantly moves toward the circumference,
and there escapes as flour.</p>

215. <b>Bends in Rivers.</b>&mdash;We see the operation of the
centrifugal force in the bends of rivers. When a bend
has once commenced in a river it is apt to increase, for
as the water sweeps along the outer bank of the bend it
presses strongly against it, just as the water in the whirled
bucket, § 214, presses against its sides, by its centrifugal
tendency, or, in other words, its tendency to assume
a straight motion. Of course the result is a wearing
away of this outer bank, and in proportion to the looseness
of the material of which it is composed and the
velocity of the river's current. And when one bend is
formed another is apt to form below, but in an opposite
direction. The water,
by sweeping along the
bend <em>a</em>, Fig. 149, is directed
by it toward the
opposite bank at <em>b</em>, and
makes a bend there also.
It is in this way that a river, running through a loose soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the Mississippi, for example, acquires a very serpentine
course. As the water in the whirled bucket rises
around the sides, so in the river the water will be
higher against the bank <em>a</em> than on the opposite
side. Eddies and whirlpools are produced on
the same principles, when water is obliged to
turn quickly around some projecting point. If
a current were moving swiftly along the shore
<em>a</em> toward the point <em>b</em>, Fig. 150, it would be directed
outward by the resistance of this projection,
and so a depression would be left at <em>c</em>, just
behind it, and this depression would be surrounded
by a revolving edge of water.</p>

216. <b>Application of the Centrifugal Force in the Arts.</b>&mdash;Much
use is made of the centrifugal force in the arts,
but I will give but two examples. In the art of pottery
the clay is made to revolve on a whirling table, the workman
at the same time giving the clay such shape as he
chooses with his hands and various instruments. In doing
this he constantly has reference to the centrifugal
force, giving the table a velocity proportioned to the
amount of this force which is needed in each stage of the
operation. The most beautiful application of this force
that I have ever witnessed is in the manufacture of common
window-glass. The glass-blower gathers up on the
end of his iron tube a quantity of the melted glass, and
blows it out into a large globe. When it is of sufficient
size and thinness he places it on a rest, as you see in Fig.
151 (p. 169). A second man now comes with a rod having
some melted glass on the end, and attaches this to the
globe at a point opposite to that where the tube of the
first man is joined to it. There now comes a boy, and,
giving this tube a quick blow, severs its connection with
the globe, leaving a hole in the globe where the glass
breaks out. The second man, having the globe attached
to his rod, carries it to a blazing furnace, and resting the
rod on a bar at its mouth, puts the globe directly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the flame. The glass is soon softened, and he whirls the
globe continually around. The hole in the globe enlarges
by the centrifugal force, and at length by this
force the globe is changed into a flat, circular disk.
Panes of glass which are called bull's-eyes are cut from
the centres of these disks.</p>

217. <b>Steam-Governor.</b>&mdash;The
operation
of the centrifugal
force is beautifully
exemplified in
this regulator of
the steam-engine.
It consists of two
heavy balls, Fig.
152, suspended by
bars from a vertical
axis, the bars being
connected to the
axis by hinges. The
bars have also a
hinged connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
at their lower ends with two smaller bars, and these latter
have a similar connection with a collar that slides up and
down on the axis. Now the faster the axis turns the farther
the balls fly out from it, from the centrifugal force,
and the higher the collar slides up on the axis. From the
collar extends, as you see, a lever. This is connected with
a valve in the steam-pipe, and so regulates the amount of
steam that enters the working part of the engine. The
object of this ingenious contrivance is to make the engine
regulate its own velocity. When it is not working too
fast the valve in the steam-pipe is wide open. But the
moment that it works too rapidly the balls extend out far
from the axis, so that the collar rises, and by the lever
partly closes the valve. Less steam, therefore, can come
to the engine, and the engine working in consequence
less rapidly, the balls fall again, opening the valve. You
see, then, that the regulation of this valve by the governor
effectually prevents the action of the engine from becoming
too rapid.</p>

218. <b>Shape of the Earth Influenced by the Centrifugal
Force.</b>&mdash;If the potter should make a ball of soft clay revolve
rapidly around on a stick run through it, the ball
would bulge out at the middle, where the centrifugal
force is greatest, and would be flattened at the ends
where the stick runs through it. This is precisely what
has happened to the earth. At the equator, where the
centrifugal force is greatest, it has bulged out about thirteen
miles, while it is flattened
at the poles. This shape was
of course assumed before the
earth became solid. In Fig.
153 we have the shape of the
earth represented, N S being
the polar diameter, and E E'
the equatorial diameter. The
tendency to take this shape
from the centrifugal force may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
be illustrated by the instrument
represented in Fig.
154. It consists of a set of
circular hoops of brass, with
an axis, <em>b a</em>. The hoops are
fastened to the axis at <em>a</em>, but
are left free at <em>b</em>. By a little
machinery at the top they
can be made to revolve
rapidly, and bulging out at
the sides by the centrifugal
force, they slide down on
the axis at <em>b</em>.</p>

<p><a name="P_219" id="P_219"></a>
219. <b>Projectiles.</b>&mdash;I have already spoken of projectiles
in § 211. You saw there that any body, as a cannon-ball,
which is projected horizontally, falls to the earth in
a curved line. Two forces act on the ball; viz., the projectile
force given by the powder and the force of gravitation.
The force of gravity being always the same,
the shape of the curve which the projected body describes
must depend on the force with which it is projected.
This is very strikingly exemplified in the curves
described by the different streams of water in Fig. 141.
But whether the projectile force be great or small, the
moving body thrown horizontally will in every case
reach the ground in the same time. Thus if two cannons
stand side by side on a height, one of which will
send a ball a mile and the other half a mile, the two
balls, if fired together, will reach the ground at the same
instant, though at first thought it would seem that the
ball which travels twice as far as the other would take a
longer time to do it in. This is because the <em>horizontal</em>
force of the ball does not oppose in the least the <em>downward</em>
force of gravity. If it were thrown upward instead
of horizontally, the projectile force would be opposed
to gravity, and in proportion as the direction
came near to being vertical. As horizontal force does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
not interfere with the action of the force of gravity, it
follows that a ball dropped at the instant at which another
is fired will reach the ground at the same instant
that the fired ball does. This can be made clear by Fig.
155. Suppose it takes three seconds for a ball to fall
from the top of a tower to its foot. In the first second
it falls to <em>a</em>. The ball projected horizontally from the
cannon, being operated upon by the same force of gravity,
will fall just as far, and will be on a level with it at
<em>b</em>. Both balls fall farther and farther each second, both
being accelerated in the same degree because it is done
by the same force. The projected ball will reach <em>d</em> when
the falling ball is at <em>c</em>, and the plain at <em>f</em> when the falling
ball is at <em>e</em>, the foot of the tower. The same holds true
in all cases. A bullet dropped from a level with the barrel
of a gun, paradoxical as it may seem, will fall to the
ground no sooner than one which is shot from the gun.</p>

220. <b>All Falling Bodies really Projected.</b>&mdash;When a
body falls from any height, it does not, as you have already
seen in § 187, fall in a straight line, as it appears
to do. It falls in a curved line, for, like all projectiles, it
is acted upon by a horizontal force as well as the force
of gravity. But what is this horizontal force? It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
motion which the body has in common with the earth in
its rotation on its axis. In this rotation the height from
which the body falls goes to the eastward 1500 feet in a
second. If, therefore, the body did not partake of the
motion of the earth, and went to the ground in a <em>straight</em>
line in a second, it would be when it reached the ground
1500 feet westward from the foot of the height from
which it fell. But it does partake of the earth's motion,
and goes eastward as fast as the height does, and so describes
the curved line of a projectile.
Suppose a ball falls from a height A,
Fig. 156, and in a second of time that
height passes to C. The forward or
projectile force would tend to carry
the ball to C, and the force of gravity would tend to carry
it to B. But both forces acting together, it pursues a
middle path, and this path is a curved line, because one
of the forces is a continued force, § 213. For the same
reason, if a ball be dropped from a railway car in motion,
and it takes a second for it to fall, it will be at the
end of that second just under that part of the car from
which it fell. Although the car may have moved a considerable
distance, the dropped ball, partaking of its motion,
goes along with it in its fall. So a ball dropped
from a mast-head when a ship is in motion goes along
with the ship in its fall. The ball in each of these cases
describes in its fall a curved line.</p>

<p><a name="P_221" id="P_221"></a>
221. <b>Motion in Orbits.</b>&mdash;Why is it, let us ask, that a
cannon-ball shot horizontally from some great height will
not revolve around the earth like the moon. It has the
same two forces acting upon it as the moon has&mdash;viz., a
projectile force, and the attraction of the earth&mdash;and both
ball and moon describe a curve in their motion. But
the curve of the ball bends to the earth, while that of
the moon ever sweeps around the earth. Why is this?
First, there is the resistance of the air continually retarding
the velocity of the ball. But, secondly, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the ball could be projected from an elevation sufficiently
high to be outside of the atmosphere, the force of the
projection would not be great enough. We know, from
the rate of progress of the heavenly bodies in their orbits,
that it would require an immense velocity to keep
the ball from being brought to the earth by its attraction.
The Creator of these worlds, when he launched
them into their orbits, gave them precisely that impulse
which is needed to balance the centripetal force of attraction,
and so they pursue a middle course between
the two directions in which these two forces tend to
carry them. And as their velocities have never been
retarded by the resistance of air or any other substance,
they have been ever the same from the beginning.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MECHANICAL POWERS.</span></h3>


<p><a name="P_222" id="P_222"></a>
222. <b>Machines not Sources of Power.</b>&mdash;The Mechanical
Powers, as they are termed, are six in number&mdash;viz.,
the Lever, the Wheel and Axle, the Inclined Plane, the
Screw, and the Wedge. They are not, strictly speaking,
powers; for, as you will see in the course of our investigation,
they are merely means of applying power to
advantage, and are not in reality sources of power. The
true sources of power are the causes of motion treated
of in § 181. The instrument or machine can not create
power, and the only use of all the variety of tools and
machinery is to enable us to <em>apply</em> power in such a manner,
with such a velocity, and in such a direction, as to
effect the objects which we have in view. The term Mechanical
Power, then, is not strictly proper as applied to
those contrivances which commonly have this name; but
the term is in so general use that it would not be well
to alter it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Every instrument, however simple and insignificant,
and every machine, however large or complicated, is an
example of some one of the six Mechanical Powers, or
of a combination of them. I will proceed to consider
each of these separately. In doing this certain terms
will be used which I will first explain. <em>Power</em> is the force
by which a machine or instrument is moved. <em>Weight</em> is
the resistance to be overcome. If the resistance be in
some other form than that of weight it is called technically
by this name. So what is called Power may be in the
form of weight. The <em>fulcrum</em> is the point on which the
instrument or machine is supported while it is in motion.</p>

<p><a name="P_223" id="P_223"></a>
223. <b>The Lever.</b>&mdash;The Lever is the most simple of all
the Mechanical Powers, and is therefore in universal use.
Though the savage makes use of but few tools in comparison
with the civilized man, he uses the lever almost
constantly in some form or other. The wedge is the
only one of the other Mechanical Powers that he uses to
any great extent. Levers are of three kinds, which I
will notice separately.</p>

<p><a name="P_224" id="P_224"></a>
224. <b>Lever of the First Kind.</b>&mdash;In the lever of the first
kind the fulcrum or prop is between the weight and the
power. The common
crow-bar or hand-spike
is a familiar example,
as seen in Fig.
157&mdash;the stone, S, or
other heavy body to
be moved being the weight, the stone or block of wood,
F, on which the bar rests being the fulcrum, and the
pressure of the hand, H, the power. The nearer the fulcrum
is to the weight, or the
farther is the power from the
fulcrum, the greater is the
force of the lever. This may be
illustrated on Fig. 158. Here
the short arm of the lever, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
it is called, C W, is one eighth of the length of the long
arm, A C. If the weight hanging at the end of the short
arm be 72 pounds, a weight of 9 pounds, or the force of
a hand amounting to this, will balance it at the end of
the long arm. But if the power should be applied at
only four times the distance from the fulcrum at which
the weight is, then it would require a force of 18 pounds
to balance the 72 pounds on the short arm. Similar variations
can be made by altering the length of the short
arm. The power and the weight will balance each other
if the weight multiplied by the length of the short arm,
and the power multiplied by the length of the long arm,
give equal products.</p>

<p><a name="P_225" id="P_225"></a>
225. <b>Scales and Steelyards.</b>&mdash;In the common scale-beam
we have a lever, the two arms of which are equal,
and therefore equal weights suspended at the ends balance.
If they be not exactly equal, a heavier weight will
be necessary on the shorter arm than on the longer. The
inequality will injure the buyer if the prop be too near
the scale in which the weights are placed, and the seller
if it be too near that which holds the article to be sold.
Any difference can be easily detected by changing the
places of the article and the weights. Whenever cheating
is practiced by the "false balance," it is of course
done in a small way, to avoid any observation by the eye
of the inequality of the two arms of the scale-beam, and
the weight of the scale hanging from the shorter arm is
made a little greater than that of the other, so that they
may balance. Scales may be rendered very accurate by
making the fulcrum or pivot of hardened steel, and of a
wedge shape, with a sharp edge, in order to avoid friction
as much as possible. The steelyard differs from the
scale-beam in having the arms of different lengths. The
principles on which this instrument is constructed were
developed in what I said of Fig. 158. When either with
the balance or the steelyard two weights balance each
other the centre of the weights and the apparatus taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
together is just over the fulcrum, § 195. We see in this
the reason that it is necessary to have the prop near the
large weight when we wish to balance it by a small one.</p>

<p><a name="P_226" id="P_226"></a>
226. <b>Other Examples.</b>&mdash;Scissors are double levers of
the first kind. The fulcrum is the rivet, the weight or
the resistance to be overcome is the article to be cut, and
the power is applied to the long arms of the levers by
the fingers. With large shears hard substances can be
cut. Even plates of iron are cut like paper by shears
which are worked by a steam-engine.&mdash;Pincers are double
levers. The hinge, or rivet, is the fulcrum.&mdash;The
common hammer, as used in drawing nails, is a good
example of the power of this kind of lever. Though
crooked, it acts in the same way with a straight lever.
The fulcrum is the point on the board where the hammer
rests, and this is between the resistance to be moved,
the nail, and the power, that is, the hand which grasps
the handle.</p>

<p><a name="P_227" id="P_227"></a>
227. <b>No Gain of Power in this Lever.</b>&mdash;I will now illustrate
the truth that there is no gain or saving of power
in this lever, though at first thought it would seem that
there is. Let <em>a b</em>, Fig. 159, represent
a lever, and <em>e</em> its fulcrum.
Let the arm <em>a e</em> be twice as long
as <em>e b</em>. A pound, therefore, suspended
from <em>a</em> will balance two
pounds at <em>b</em>. If, now, when the
weights are suspended, the long
arm be raised so that the lever
shall be in the position represented
by the line <em>c d</em>, and then
let go, the one pound at <em>c</em>, balancing
the two pounds at <em>d</em>, will bring the lever again to
the position <em>a b</em>. It will be perceived that the end of the
long arm of the lever moves through the space <em>a c</em>, which
is larger than <em>b d</em>, through which the end of the short
arm moves, in the same time. The one-pound weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in fact, falls two feet in raising the two-pound weight
one foot, and it moves twice as far as a one-pound weight
suspended at <em>i</em> would. If a one-pound weight could raise
a two-pound weight without thus moving through twice
as much space we might then say that there is an actual
gain of power in the lever. But it evidently makes no
difference whether one pound moves through two feet
or two pounds through one foot; the force is the same
in both cases. For the momentum or force of a moving
body is in proportion to its weight and velocity, § 201;
and therefore the pound weight, moving through two
feet, has as much momentum as the two-pound weight
moving through one foot in the same time. The small
weight does the same amount of work that the larger
one would by moving twice as far in the same time as
the larger, just as a boy, who carries a load half as large
as a man, will do as much work as the man if he carry it
twice as fast.</p>

228. <b>The See-Saw.</b>&mdash;We
see the same
thing illustrated in
the see-saw, Fig. 160.
The man, being much
heavier than the boy,
is nearer the prop,
and as they move up
and down the boy
passes over a much
larger space than the
man, describing an
arc in a much larger
circle.</p>

<p><a name="P_229" id="P_229"></a>
229. <b>Archimedes's Lever.</b>&mdash;Archimedes said that if he
could have a lever long enough and a prop strong enough
he could move the world by his own weight. But he
did not think how far he would have to move to do this,
from the vast difference between his weight and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
weight of the earth. "He would have required," says
Dr. Arnot, "to move with the velocity of a cannon-ball
for millions of years to alter the position of the earth by
a small part of an inch."</p>

<p><a name="P_230" id="P_230"></a>
230. <b>An Analogy.</b>&mdash;You will remember that in the
case of the Hydrostatic Paradox, the Hydrostatic Bellows,
and Bramah's Press (§ 131, § 132, and § 133), great
effects are produced by a small power. But this small
power has to execute an extensive motion in order to
produce these effects. Thus, as stated in § 132, if the
area of the top of the Hydrostatic Bellows be one thousand
times the area of the tube, though the water poured
into the tube will raise a very great weight on the bellows,
the water in the tube must fall ten inches in raising
the weight the hundredth part of an inch. So when the
pressure of the hand on the long arm of a lever moves a
great weight, as a heavy stone, the weight is moved but
a little, while the extent of the hand's motion is comparatively
very great.</p>

231. <b>Lever of the Second Kind.</b>&mdash;In the second kind
of lever the weight is between
the fulcrum and the power,
as you see in Fig. 161. The
same rule of equilibrium applies
here as in the case of the
lever of the first kind. The
72 pounds of weight can be
sustained by 8 pounds of power,
because the power acts on
the lever at 9 times the distance from the fulcrum that
the weight does, for 1×72 = 9×8. The common wheel-barrow,
Fig. 162 (p. 180), is an example of this kind of
lever. The point at which the wheel presses on the
ground is the fulcrum, and the weight is the load, its
downward pressure from its centre of gravity being indicated
at M. Of course the nearer the load is to the
fulcrum the easier it is, on starting, to raise the handles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
The crow-bar can be
used as a lever of this
kind when its point
is placed beyond the
weight to be raised.
The chipping-knife,
Fig. 163, is another example.
The end, F, attached
to the board, is
the fulcrum, the hand
pressing at P the power, and the resistance of the substance
R, which is to be cut, is the weight. Nut-crackers
have a similar arrangement. In
shutting a door by pushing it near its
edge we move a lever of this kind.
The hinge is the fulcrum, and the
weight is between this and the hand.
We see, then, the reason that the slight push of a hand
shutting the door may even crush a finger when caught
in it at the side where the hinges are. The finger is a
resistance so near the fulcrum that the power moving
through a great space acts upon it with immense force.
The same explanation applies to the severe bite of the
finger when it is caught in the hinge of a pair of tongs.
The oar of a boat is a lever of this kind, the weight to
be moved being the boat, which is between the power,
the hand of the rower, and the fulcrum, the resisting
water.</p>

232. <b>Lever of the Third Kind.</b>&mdash;In the third kind of
lever the power is between
the fulcrum and the weight,
as seen in Fig. 164. In the
first two kinds of lever the
power may be less than the
weight, but in this the power
must always be greater than
the weight. This lever has,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
then, no mechanical advantage, as that expression is
commonly used. Applying the same rule here as in the
other levers, see what is the result. If the weight, as in
Fig. 164, be 9 times as far from the fulcrum as the power
is, it will require a power equal to a weight of 648 pounds
to sustain a weight of 72 pounds, for 9×72=1×648.</p>

233. <b>Examples.</b>&mdash;When a man puts his foot against
the end of a ladder, and raises it by taking hold of one
of the rounds, the ladder is a lever of this kind. It is
evident that he spends his force upon it at a great mechanical
disadvantage, for the power is applied much
nearer to the fulcrum than the weight of the ladder,
taken as a whole, is. If you push a door to by placing
your hand very near the hinges, you do not shut it as
easily as when you take hold of it at its edge. In the
first case it is a lever of the third kind, and the hand
moves through a small space, and therefore must exert
a considerable force; while in the latter case the door is
a lever of the second kind, and the hand, moving through
a greater space, puts forth less force. When we use a
pair of tongs we use a pair of levers of the third kind.
They are an instrument in which convenience rather than
power is needed. We can not grasp any thing very
firmly with them because the power is so much nearer
to the fulcrum than the weight to be lifted. For this
reason a pinch with the ends of the tongs is nothing compared
with one in the hinge. The most beautiful example
of this lever we have in the moving apparatus of animals.
Take, for example, the principal muscle which
bends the elbow, as represented in Fig. 165 (p. 182). This
comes down from the shoulder in front of the bone of the
arm, and is inserted just below the elbow-joint into one of
the bones of the forearm. It pulls upon the forearm very
near the fulcrum, which is the elbow-joint, and so acts at
a great mechanical disadvantage. The object of this arrangement
is to secure quickness of movement, which is
here, as in almost all muscular motions, of more import<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>ance
than great strength. When great weights are lifted
the fact that the muscles act at such mechanical disadvantage
makes the exhibition of power wonderful.</p>

234. <b>Compound Levers.</b>&mdash;When several levers are connected
together we call the whole apparatus a compound
lever. Let each
of the levers in
Fig. 166 be 3
inches long, the
long arms being 2 inches,
and the short ones 1 inch. One pound at A will, according
to the rule, balance 2 at B, and 2 at B will balance
4 at C, and 4 at C will balance 8 at D. Therefore 1
pound at A will balance 8 pounds at D. And you see
that an equilibrium is effected when the power is to the
weight as the product of all the short arms is to the product
of all the long arms. The compound lever is used in
weighing heavy loads&mdash;as hay, coal, etc. You have a
representation
of the arrangement
in Fig.
167. The load,
W, stands on
a platform,
A B, which
rests upon two
levers, E D<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and E C. The long arms of these levers are E G and
E F, and the short arms are G D and F C. The ends of
the long arms press upon the fulcrum of the lever, H I.
The pressure is now transmitted from the end of the long
arm by the rod, I K, to a small lever, K L, where a small
weight or power, P, balances the weight of the heavy
load, W. The two objects secured by this arrangement
are accuracy and the occupation of a small space.</p>

235. <b>Wheel and Axle.</b>&mdash;The mechanical power next
in simplicity to the lever is the Wheel and Axle. The
most familiar applications of this power we see in drawing
water and in raising heavy articles
in stores. The principle of this
power is the same as that of the
lever, as may be shown in Fig. 168,
which represents a section of the
wheel and axle. The power, P,
hangs by a cord which goes round
the wheel, and the weight, W, by a
cord around the axle. We may consider
the power as pulling on a lever
represented by A B, the long arm
of which is A C, and the short arm B C. You see that
the wheel and axle, then, may be viewed as a constant
succession of levers, and it is therefore sometimes called
the perpetual lever. And the same rule of equilibrium
applies here as in the simple lever.</p>

windlass the power is applied
to a winch or crank, D C B,
Fig. 169, instead of a wheel. In
estimating the power of this arrangement
B C must be considered
the long arm of the lever, and
half of the diameter of the axle,
B A, as its short arm.</p>

170 and 171,
the axle is in
a vertical position.
The top
of it is pierced
with holes, into
which levers
are introduced.
In Fig. 170
you see the instrument
as it
is commonly used in moving buildings. Sometimes
horse-power is applied at the ends of the levers. Great
power is exerted by this instrument; but we have the
same fact here as in all cases where a small force produces
a great effect&mdash;the effect is
slow, and the force passes over a
great space in producing it. The
moving of a building a foot requires
many circuits of the horse
around the axle. Fig. 171 gives
us the capstan as it is commonly
on board ship. The head of it is
circular, with many holes for levers, so that many men
can work together in raising a heavy anchor.</p>

238. <b>Fusee of a Watch.</b>&mdash;In the fusee of a watch we
have a wheel and axle of a peculiar construction. When
we wind up a watch the chain
is wound around the spiral path-way
on the fusee, B, Fig. 172,
and at the same time the spring
is coiled up tightly in the round
box, A. The spring, in gradually
uncoiling itself, turns this
round box around, and thus pulls upon the chain, <em>c</em>, making
the fusee to revolve, and so give motion to other
parts of the machinery. Now the spring, in its effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
uncoil, acts strongest at first; and therefore if the fusee
were of uniform size the watch would go fastest when
first wound up, and go gradually slower as it run down.
This difficulty is obviated by giving the power a small
wheel to pull on at first, and gradually enlarging the
wheel as the spring uncoils. This is because, in order to
produce a certain effect on a given weight by a power,
the less the power is the longer must be the arm of the
lever on which the power acts.</p>

239. <b>The Pulley.</b>&mdash;The third mechanical power is the
Pulley. Pulleys are <em>fixed</em> or <em>movable</em>.
In Fig. 173 you have a fixed pulley.
There is no mechanical advantage in
this pulley, for its action may be conceived
of as the action of successive levers
of equal arms, B F and A F, and
therefore equilibrium requires an equality
of the power and weight. But this
pulley is often a great convenience. For
example, a man can raise himself or
some weight to any desired elevation,
as seen in Fig. 174. It is used also in effecting descents.
With two fixed pulleys
a horizontal
force may be used
in raising a weight
vertically, as seen in
Fig. 175. In using
a fixed pulley either
one or the other of
two objects is attained&mdash;applying
force where we could
not otherwise apply it, and changing the direction of its
application.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p><a name="P_240" id="P_240"></a>
240. <b>Movable Pulley.</b>&mdash;You have a representation of
a movable pulley in Fig. 176 (p. 186). It is evident here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that the force of the weight is
equally divided between the cords,
A B, so that the cord B, extending
over the fixed pulley, needs to
have a weight, P, but half of the
weight W to balance it. A movable
pulley is sometimes called a
"runner," and a fixed pulley is
commonly connected with it, in
order to give the desired direction
to the force. Many pulleys
are often connected together in
various ways, as seen in Fig. 177.
It is easy to estimate in such cases
the relation of the power to the weight on the principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
developed in relation to the lever. If, for example, in
the system of pulleys on the left, the weight be 36 pounds,
the two cords of the first pulley will each sustain a weight
of 18 pounds, those of the next pulley each 9 pounds, and
those of the next each 4½ pounds. The weight W then
will be balanced by the weight P if it weigh 4½ pounds.</p>

241. <b>Inclined Plane.</b>&mdash;The fourth mechanical power is
the Inclined Plane. This being a very simple contrivance
is much used, especially when heavy bodies are to
be raised only a small height, as in getting large boxes
and hogsheads into stores. The mechanical advantage
of the inclined plane may be
illustrated on Fig. 178. The
line A <em>c</em> represents an inclined
plane. If a weight be drawn
up this plane it is raised only
the height B <em>c</em>. A smaller
power is requisite to draw
the weight up the plane than
to raise it perpendicularly; and the power necessary will
be the less the longer the plane. A power which would
balance a weight on an inclined plane would be to the
weight as the height of the plane to its length. Thus if
A <em>c</em> be twice as long as B <em>c</em>, a weight of four pounds on
the plane may be balanced by a two-pound weight suspended
by a cord passing from the weight over the summit
of the plane. A flight of stairs is an inclined plane
in regard to the principle on which the ascent is effected,
the projections in it being for the purpose of affording a
sure footing in making the ascent or the descent. So
likewise hogsheads are let down the steps of a cellar-way
by ropes, and it makes no difference in the principle of
the operation whether the steps have or have not planks
laid along them. It is supposed that the immense stones
in the pyramids and other massive Egyptian structures
were put into their position by means of the inclined
plane. Roads, when they are not level, are inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
planes, and the steeper the inclination the more power
is required to draw a load up the road. Great mistakes
were formerly made in carrying roads too frequently
over high hills. Besides failing to take advantage of
the principles of the inclined plane, in many cases the
horse in going over a hill passes over quite as much
space as he would if the road were made to go round
the base of the hill, and sometimes even more. If the
hill were a perfect hemisphere, a road over it would be
just equal in length to a road around its base to the opposite
point.</p>

<p><a name="P_242" id="P_242"></a>
242. <b>The Wedge.</b>&mdash;This is the fifth of the mechanical
powers. It may be considered as two inclined planes
placed with their bases together, as
seen in Fig. 179. Indeed, sometimes
the wedge has one side only
inclined, it being only half of the
ordinary wedge. The difference
between the inclined plane and the wedge in operation
is, that in the first the inclined plane is fixed, and the
weight is made to move up along its surface, while in
the latter the weight, that is, the resistance, is stationary,
and the surface of the plane is made to move along
upon it. The power of the wedge is estimated just as
the power of the inclined plane is, that is, by comparing
the thickness of the wedge with the length of its side.
The less the thickness of the wedge compared with its
length, obviously the more powerful is the wedge as a
penetrating instrument. The wedge is used for splitting
blocks of wood and stone, for producing great pressures,
for raising heavy bodies, etc. All cutting and piercing
instruments, knives, razors, axes, needles, pins, nails, etc.,
act on the principle of the wedge.</p>

<p><a name="P_243" id="P_243"></a>
243. <b>The Screw.</b>&mdash;This is the sixth mechanical power.
The principle of it is essentially that of the inclined plane.
The "thread" running around the screw is an inclined
plane which is spiral instead of straight, and so is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the corresponding part in the nut an inclined plane running
in the opposite direction. In the common screw
the nut is fixed, and the screw is made to play up and
down in it; but sometimes the screw is fixed, and the
nut is made to play around it. The screw acts like a
wedge, and has the same relation to a straight wedge
that a road winding up a hill has to a straight road of
the same length and rise. Especially does the comparison
hold when the screw is forced into wood; the wedge
goes straight into the wood, but the edge of the screw's
thread enters the wood spirally.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-189.jpg" width="150" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 180.</div>
</div>

<p>To estimate the force of the screw we compare the
length of one turn of the thread
around it with the height to which
the thread rises in going round. Let
<em>a b</em>, Fig. 180, represent one turn of
the thread, and <em>b c</em> the height to
which it goes. It is clear from the
figure that the principle which applies
to the inclined plane and to the
wedge applies here also. As the
less is the height of the plane the
easier it is for a weight to be drawn
up it; and as the less is the depth of the wedge the less
is it resisted; so, also, the less the height of the turn of
the screw's thread the easier is it to move the screw,
and the greater is the force which it exerts. Hence the
prodigious power of a screw with a thread which rises
very slowly in its spiral turns. Screws are much used
when great pressure is required, as in pressing oils and
juices from vegetable substances, in compressing cotton
into bales, in bringing together with firm grasp the jaws
of the vice, etc. In turning the screw a bar is used, so
that we have in this instrument the combined advantages
of the screw and the lever. That you may have
some idea of the power of these two instruments acting
together I will suppose a case. Let the weight to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
raised by a screw be 10,000 pounds. Let a turn of the
screw be 10 inches long, and the rise be but one inch.
Then, so far as the screw is concerned, the power requisite
to raise the 10,000 pounds will be 1000&mdash;the ratio
of the height of the thread's turn to its length. But the
power of the lever is yet to be estimated. Let the length
of the lever, passed through the head of the screw so that
it is equal on each side, be 30 inches. The diameter of
the screw is about three inches, or one-tenth of the diameter
of the circle described by the end of the lever. It
will now take but a power of 100 pounds to raise the
weight, the ratio of the radius of the screw to half the
length of the lever.</p>

<p><a name="P_244" id="P_244"></a>
244. <b>Truly but Three Mechanical Powers.</b>&mdash;The Wheel
and Axle, you have seen, is merely a modification of the
Lever, and the Wedge and the Screw are modifications
of the Inclined Plane. The Mechanical Powers are, then,
in reality but three&mdash;the Lever, Pulley, and Inclined
Plane. And these are the elements of all machinery,
from the simplest tool that is used for the most common
purposes to the most complicated and powerful engine
which the ingenuity of man ever designed. The principle
upon which a pin is shaped is identical with that of
the wedge, by which large masses are cleft in two; and
the instrument by which the finest textures are cut by
delicate fingers is arranged on the same principle with
those varied contrivances by which immense weights are
raised by a comparatively small power, viz., the principle
of the lever.</p>

<p><a name="P_245" id="P_245"></a>
245. <b>Friction in Machinery.</b>&mdash;You have seen, as we
have proceeded, that the Mechanical Powers, though
thus named, do not generate power. So far from this,
there is really a loss of power in their use, chiefly from
friction. In raising a weight, for example, directly by
the hand, there is no loss from this cause; but if you use
a pulley you have the friction of the cord upon it, and a
loss of power in proportion to the amount of friction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
In some cases the loss of power from this cause is so
great as to call for a considerable variation from such
calculations as we have made in this chapter in regard
to the relations of power and weight in machinery. In
the operations of the screw friction has a great influence
in diminishing the power of the instrument.</p>

<p><a name="P_246" id="P_246"></a>
246. <b>The Real Advantages of the Mechanical Powers.</b>&mdash;If
there is then no saving, but a loss of power in tools
and machinery, what, let us inquire, are their advantages?</p>

<p>If one man can do alone by the aid of some instrument
what would otherwise require the exertion of many men,
though he be slow in doing it, yet it is a great advantage.
Thus one man can with a lever move a stone which
perhaps it would require thirty men to move without it,
and though it take him thirty times as long, it saves him
the trouble of getting a company of men to help him.
So if a man can raise his goods by a wheel and axle to
the upper loft of his store, though he raise them slower
than several men would lift them directly by ropes, it is
an advantage to him, as it saves the hiring of a company
of laborers. A few men by a capstan can raise an anchor
which could be raised without it only by a large company
of men.</p>

<p>Another advantage often is that there may be intervals
of rest in applying the force without any loss. This
is obvious in the case of the pulley, but still more so in
the case of the screw. It is friction in both these cases
which enables the workman to rest. It saves to him all
that he has gained by opposing any tendency to slip
back. We see the same thing in the wedge. When this
is driven into wood, it remains because it is prevented
from returning by the friction of the wood against its
sides. It is the same cause which holds a nail in its
place, and opposes any effort to draw it out. In driving
the wedge the workman can have as long intervals as he
pleases between his blows, because friction saves all that
is gained. This effect is very well exemplified in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
capstan, Fig. 170. It requires but little exertion of the
man who sits there to hold the rope, because the few
turns of it around the axle prevent its slipping easily.</p>

<p>A third advantage which often attends the use of tools
and machines is that force may be made to produce motion
at various distances, in various directions, and in various
degrees of velocity. Thus as to distance, a man
standing on the ground can raise a weight to the top of
a house by a pulley. So, also, a water-wheel may by the
connections of machinery produce motion at considerable
distances from it. Then as to direction, horizontal motion
may be converted into vertical, rotary into straight,
etc. The velocity of motion is generally varied by cog-wheels.
Thus a wheel of 60 cogs revolving once in a
minute, playing on a wheel of 10 cogs, will make it revolve
once in 6 seconds.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-192.jpg" width="75" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 181.</div>
</div>

<p>Another advantage of tools and machines is that they
secure a better mode of applying power than we otherwise
could have. Thus when several men are pulling on
a rope much power is lost by their pulling irregularly, a
difficulty which is removed by the pulley. The same
can be said of applying pressure by the screw. One
man presses more steadily, and therefore more effectually,
than fifty men would without the screw. The arrangements
of tools and machines are so made as to provide
convenient ways of applying our strength. An instrument,
for example, for moving a weight by hand is
so shaped as to hold the weight well, and also to afford
a good handle for the hand to grasp. The common claw
hammer is a very good illustration. We grasp
the nail by an iron claw, with the handle we
can apply not merely the force of the hand,
but that of the whole arm, and then we have
the immense lever power of the instrument.
We have a good illustration of convenience
in an instrument, in what is called a Lewis,
represented in Fig. 181. It is used for raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
blocks of stone in building. It has three parts, A B C.
It is used in this way: A hole is made in the upper part
of the block of stone to be raised in shape like the instrument;
then A and C are inserted, and B is pushed
in between them. With the ring, D, bolted through the
instrument the stone is raised to its place by the ordinary
machinery. The principle of the instrument, you see,
is that of the wedge.</p>

247. <b>Man a Tool-Making Animal.</b>&mdash;Though there is no
actual saving of power in the tools and machines which
man uses, yet so great are the advantages which he reaps
from them, that more than two thousand years ago a
philosopher thought that man could not be better distinguished
from brutes than by calling him a tool-making
animal. If the distinction was so striking in the time
of Aristotle, when tools and machines were so few in number
and so rudely contrived, and so few of the sources
of power were appropriated by man to his use, how
much more striking is it now, with all the variety and
perfection of instruments and machinery, and with the
ever-extending appropriation of the sources of power furnished
by the elements. The power which air and water
and gravitation give is applied constantly with more
and more variety and effect; and the appropriation of
that mighty source of power, steam, is wholly a modern
invention.</p>

248. <b>What Sound is.</b>&mdash;Sound is such a vibration of
substances as can, on being transmitted to the ear, act
upon the sense of hearing. I say <em>such</em> a vibration, because
there may be vibrations which will not produce
the sensation of sound, Vibrations which are either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
very slow or very quick will not do it. Thus if a plate
of metal or a string make less than 15 or more than
48,000 vibrations in a second, no effect is produced upon
the ear. The capacity of hearing differs, however, in
different persons, so that although few can hear vibrations
which are beyond the range which I have mentioned,
there are many whose capacity falls much within
it either at one end or both ends of the scale. The range
for animals is not the same as that for man. Thus the
lion and the elephant can hear a sound when the vibrations
are too infrequent to make any impression upon
our ears; while small animals have a susceptibility in the
organ of hearing for vibrations so quick that we can not
hear them, and at the same time are not susceptible to
the slower vibrations. How far the range varies in different
animals has not been ascertained to any extent.</p>

249. <b>The Vibration of Sounding Bodies Manifest to the
Senses.</b>&mdash;If we place the hand upon a large bell
that has been struck we can feel the vibration.
If we strike one of the ends of a tuning-fork
upon some hard body we can see the vibration,
as represented in Fig. 182 by the dotted lines.
If we look in upon the strings of a piano as it is
played, the vibration of the larger strings is very
observable to the eye. If we rub the edge of a
drinking-glass so as to produce a musical sound,
the water which is in it will be thrown into
waves from the vibration of the glass.</p>

250. <b>Wind Instruments.</b>&mdash;In wind instruments,
as the flute, horn, etc., it is the vibration of the
body of air in the instrument which causes the
sound. In the common tin whistle or bird-call,
Fig. 183, the sound is produced
by the vibration imparted to the
contained air by the impulse of
the breath through the orifice, B.</p>

<p><a name="P_251" id="P_251"></a>
251. <b>An Analogy.</b>&mdash;The vibration of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sounding body is much like that of a pendulum. The
end of the tuning-fork, Fig. 182, on being struck passes
to <em>b</em>, and in returning passes by the point of rest, A, as
the pendulum does, and
reaches <em>a</em>. So, also, if a
string, A B, Fig. 184, be
drawn aside to D, as it
flies back to C it will by its inertia pass on to E, and so
will continue to vibrate back and forth for some time.
The same rule also applies to the extent of the vibrations
here as in the case of the pendulum, § 209. The quickness
of the vibration is not at all affected by its width.
The farther the string, A B, is drawn to one side the
greater will be the force with which it will return, and
hence it will arrive at its position on the other side of
the middle line as soon when drawn far away from this
line as it would if drawn but little away. The same
thing is true of the vibrations or waves of air, though it
can not so easily be made plain to you.</p>

252. <b>How the Sensation of Sound is Produced.</b>&mdash;The
vibration of a sounding body is transmitted to the ear
ordinarily through the air, and there strikes upon a little
drum, a membrane at the bottom of the external cavity
of the ear just like a common drum-head. Here the vibration
of the air is communicated to this drum, and
from this to a chain of very small bones. From the last
of these bones it is transmitted to another very small
drum, and from this to a fluid in some very complicated
passages in the most solid bone in the body. These may
be called the <em>halls of audience</em>. In the fluid contained
in them are spread out the branches of the nerve of hearing,
which receive the impression of the vibration, and
transmit it to the brain, where the mind takes knowledge
of it. Observe that the vibration, transmitted first
through the air, then through the drum, then the chain
of bones, then another drum to a fluid, stops at the
fluid. What is transmitted from this to the brain by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the nerve we know not, and so we call it an impression.</p>

<p><a name="P_253" id="P_253"></a>
253. <b>Sound Transmitted through Various Substances.</b>&mdash;In
ordinary hearing sound, as you have seen, is transmitted
through various substances before the vibration
arrives at the liquid in the halls of audience. But sound
need not take this course in all cases to arrive at the
nerve of hearing. If, for example, you place a watch
between your teeth, the sound will go through the solid
teeth and the bones of the jaw directly to the halls of
audience by a short cut, instead of going round through
the outer ear-passage to the drum, and so through the
chain of bones. Fishes in hearing receive the vibration
through water. If you place your ear at the end of a
timber, while some one scratches with a pin at the other
end, you hear the sound distinctly, for the vibration is
transmitted through the timber; as in the case of the
watch between the teeth, it goes through the solid bone.</p>

254. <b>Sound not Transmitted through a Vacuum.</b>&mdash;As
sound is a vibration of some substance it can not be
transmitted through absolute space. This can be proved
by an experiment with the air-pump, as represented in
Fig. 185. The apparatus in the receiver
is so arranged that the bell,
<em>a</em>, can be struck by pressing down a
sliding rod, <em>h</em>. If it be struck before
the air is exhausted the sound is
heard through the glass. But the
more you exhaust the air the fainter
will be the sound; and at length, if
you keep on pumping, it can not be
heard at all. The same experiment
can be tried with a music-box. It
is from the thinness of the air on
high mountains, and at the great heights reached by
balloons, that all sounds are so faint. The report of a
pistol fired off on top of Mont Blanc is a mere crack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
compared with its report when fired in the valley below.</p>

<p><a name="P_255" id="P_255"></a>
255. <b>Motion of the Heavenly Bodies without Noise.</b>&mdash;Sound
is often heard at a very great distance on the
earth. The sound of an eruption of a volcano has been
heard in one case at the distance of 970 miles. But suppose
that the same sound should occur at the same distance
from the earth, that is, over 900 miles beyond the
atmosphere that enrobes the earth, no inhabitant of our
world could hear it, for the same reason that you do not
hear the bell ringing in an exhausted receiver. If, therefore,
any sound, however loud, should be given forth by
any of the heavenly bodies we could not hear it. The
course of these bodies in their orbits is noiseless, because
they meet with no resistance from any substance. Bodies
passing rapidly through our atmosphere cause sound,
from the resistance which the air gives to their passage.
The whizzing of a ball is an example of this. It is the
passage of the electric fluid through the air which produces
the thunder. But the heavenly bodies, having no
such resistance, make no sound in their course, though
their velocity be so immense. In the expressive language
of the Bible, "their voice is not heard."</p>

<p><a name="P_256" id="P_256"></a>
256. <b>Velocity of Sound.</b>&mdash;The velocity of sound varies
in different media. Thus it passes through water four
times as rapidly as it does through air. Dr. Franklin,
with his head under water, heard distinctly the sound of
two stones struck together in the water at the distance
of more than half a mile. Sound passes through solids
much more easily, and therefore more rapidly, than
through liquids. Thus its velocity through copper is
twelve times and through glass seventeen times greater
than through air. If you place your ear against a long
brick wall at one end, and let some one strike upon the
other end, you will hear two reports, the first through
the wall and the second through the air. Indians are
in the habit of ascertaining the approach of their enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
by putting the ear to the ground. When the eruption
of a volcano is heard at a great distance the sound comes
through the solid earth rather than through the air. The
ready transmission of sound through solids furnishes us
with a very valuable means of examining diseases of the
lungs and heart. The sounds occasioned by the movement
of the air in the lungs and by the action of the
heart are very distinctly heard through the solid walls
of the chest.</p>

<p><a name="P_257" id="P_257"></a>
257. <b>Measurement of Distances by Sound.</b>&mdash;It makes
no difference with the velocity of sound whether it be
loud or not. Thus the sounds of a band of music at a
distance all reach your ear at the same time, the sounds of
the instruments that can scarcely be heard keeping exact
pace in the air with the sounds of the loudest. So, also,
the velocity of sound is uniform throughout its whole
course, being just as rapid when it is about to die away
as it was when it began. It is from this uniformity in
the velocity of sound that we can estimate the distance
of the object by which any sound is made. We do it by
a comparison between light and sound. Sound moves
at the rate of 1120 feet in a second. Now light moves
192,000 miles a second, and therefore, for all ordinary
distances on the earth, we need make no allowance of
time for light in comparison with sound. If we see, then,
the operation by which a sound is produced we can estimate
its distance from us by the length of time which
elapses between what we see and what we hear. In this
way we can estimate very accurately the distance of a
cannon that we see fired, or the distance of a flash of
lightning.</p>

<p><a name="P_258" id="P_258"></a>
258. <b>Loudness of Sound.</b>&mdash;The loudness of sound depends
upon the width of the vibrations producing it.
The harder you strike the end of the tuning-fork, Fig.
182, the farther will it vibrate the one way and the other,
and the louder will be the sound. The same thing is
true of the strings of a piano. A round bell, when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
struck, tends in its vibration to take an oval form, and
the extent of its vibration back and forth as it does this
governs the loudness of the sound. As sound passes
from the sounding body the vibration gradually lessens,
and at length dies away. It is like the successive vibrations
or waves of water produced by dropping a stone
in it. The louder the sound is the larger are the first
vibrations, and the farther will the vibrations extend, as
in water a large stone dropped into it will produce
larger waves than a small one, and the waves will extend
over a greater space.</p>

<p><a name="P_259" id="P_259"></a>
259. <b>Diffusion of Sound.</b>&mdash;When there is no hindrance
sound spreads equally in all directions. It is in this respect
with the vibrations or waves of air as it is with
the waves of water when a stone is dropped into it.
Light is also diffused in the same manner, as you will
see in another chapter.</p>

<p><a name="P_260" id="P_260"></a>
260. <b>Reflection of Sound.</b>&mdash;As waves of water striking
against any object bound off, so it is with the vibrations
or waves of sound. And the same is true of this as of
all motion, as stated in § 206, that the angle of incidence
is equal to the angle of reflection. The reflection of sound
is the cause of <em>echoes</em>. In order that an echo be perfect
the sound must be reflected back to the ear from some
plane surface of some size. Sometimes when there are
successive plane surfaces of rocks along a river there are
successive echoes. Thus in Fig. 186 (p. 200) is represented
a locality on the Rhine where a sound is reflected at successive
places, 1, 2, 3, 4. The rolling of thunder, though
sometimes caused by the different distances of parts of
the same flash of lightning, is commonly owing to reflections
of the sound among the clouds. From this cause
the report of a cannon is more apt to be a rolling sound
when there are clouds above than when the sky is clear.
Sound is continually reflected in every variety of direction
from obstacles with which it meets. Thus in a room
it is reflected from the walls and from all the objects in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the room; and the more varied are the surfaces the
more varied and confused are the reflections. You know
that a voice has a very different sound in a room when
it is empty from what it has when the room is filled with
an audience. Indeed, a blind speaker can estimate very
nearly the size of his audience by the sound of his own
voice. The explanation is, that with a full audience the
surfaces for reflection are vastly multiplied, and so deprive
the sound of the sharp and ringing character which
is given to it by reflection from comparatively few surfaces
which are plane and firm. The effect produced by
an audience upon the voice of the speaker is quite analogous
to that of muffling upon the sound of a drum.</p>

<p><a name="P_261" id="P_261"></a>
261. <b>Whispering Galleries.</b>&mdash;The reflection of sound
from curved surfaces gives us some interesting phenomena.
The waves of sound in being reflected from a concave
surface are gathered together to some point. If
the surface be a perfectly spherical one, and the sound
issue from the centre, the reflection will be from all
points to the centre. But
suppose the concave surface
have the curve of an ellipse,
as represented in Fig. 187.
This, instead of having a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
centre, has two foci, <em>c</em> and <em>g</em>. Now if a sound proceed
from one focus, <em>c</em>, the waves of sound, as represented by
the lines <em>c d</em>, <em>c e</em>, <em>c f</em>, <em>c h</em>, will all be reflected to the other
focus, <em>g</em>; so that if a person speak in a very low tone or
even whisper at <em>c</em>, he may be heard distinctly by another
at <em>g</em>, though persons at other points may hear nothing.
We may have this result with a curved wall extending
even several hundred feet; and such structures are called
whispering galleries. If in one of these galleries a person
standing in one focus speak loudly he will be heard
by others at any point by the <em>direct</em> waves of sound;
but the reflected sound will be added to the direct in
the case of one standing at the other focus.</p>

262. <b>Concentration of Sound.</b>&mdash;It is by the reflection
of sound that it can be concentrated in various ways.
Thus in using a speaking-trumpet the waves of sound,
instead of moving in all directions as soon as they escape
from the mouth,
are reflected by
the sides of the
instrument toward
a central
line as represented in Fig.
188. The waves or vibrations, being thus concentrated
have more intensity and are thrown to a greater distance
than if they issued directly from the mouth. So a speaking-tube,
confining the vibrations, carries the voice to
distant parts of a building. For the same reason the
voice can be heard much farther through a narrow
street than in an open space. So, also, a speaker can be
heard more distinctly in a hall than when addressing an
audience of the same size in the open air. The "sounding-board,"
once so fashionable in churches, was really
of considerable service in preventing the escape of the
vibrations of the voice of the preacher upward, and directing
them downward upon the audience. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hearing-trumpet, Fig. 189, the vibrations
are collected in the broad open end of the
instrument, and by reflection are thrown
together into a narrow compass before
they enter the ear to strike upon the
drum. We often instinctively make the palm of the
hand act as an ear-trumpet when we do not hear distinctly.
Many animals have the external ears movable,
so that they can direct their concave surface toward the
point from which they wish to hear. Such ears are
movable ear-trumpets.</p>

<p><a name="P_263" id="P_263"></a>
263. <b>Difference Between a Musical Sound and a Noise.</b>&mdash;The
difference between a musical sound and a noise is
very analogous to the difference between a crystal and
the same substance destitute of the crystalline arrangement.
In both there are vibrations, but in the musical
sound they have perfect regularity, while in a noise the
vibrations are irregular, and there is confusion. Indeed
so regular are the vibrations of musical sounds that the
rules and principles of music have all the rigid exactness
of mathematics.</p>

<p><a name="P_264" id="P_264"></a>
264. <b>How Different Notes are Produced.</b>&mdash;The quicker
is the vibration the higher is the note. Thus a short and
small string on a violin or in a piano gives a higher note
than a long and large string, because its vibrations are
quicker. The tension of the string also has an influence,
the note being raised by increasing the tension. In
tuning a violin the right pitch is given to each string
by lessening or increasing the tension by means of the
screws to which the strings are attached. In playing
upon it various notes are made upon each string by
shortening the vibrating portion more or less by pressure
of the finger.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-203.jpg" width="60" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 190.</div>
</div>

<p>In wind instruments the note depends on the length
and size of the column of air contained in them. This
may be illustrated by an organ-pipe, Fig. 190 (p. 203).
It is one of the pipes of what is called the flute-stop. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
is constructed very much like a boy's willow
whistle. The air from the bellows of the organ
enters at P, and causes a vibration of the whole
column of air in the pipe, the sound issuing at <em>t</em>.
In the upper end is a movable plug, <em>s</em>, by which,
in tuning, the note of the pipe is regulated. If
the note be too grave this plug is pushed downward,
so as to shorten the column of air.</p>

<p>It is from difference in rapidity of vibration
that a large bell gives a graver note than a small
one. So, too, when musical sounds are produced
by passing the moistened fingers over the edges
of glass vessels, the larger the vessel the graver
is its note. A tumbler will give a graver note
than a wine-glass.</p>

<p><a name="P_265" id="P_265"></a>
265. <b>Human Voice.</b>&mdash;The principles which I
have developed in relation to musical instruments
apply to the voice. The musical instrument of
man, by which the voice is produced, is contained
in a very small compass. It is that box at the top of the
throat commonly called Adam's apple. Across this, from
front to rear, stretch two sheets of membrane, leaving a
space between their edges. In our ordinary breathing
these membranes are relaxed, and the space between
their edges is considerable, to allow the air to pass in
and out freely. But when we speak or sing these membranes,
or vocal chords, as they are termed, are put into
a tense state by muscles pulling upon them, and the opening
between them is lessened. The voice is produced by
the air that is forced out from the lungs, which, striking
on the chords, causes them to vibrate. The nearer their
edges are together, and the more tense they are, the
higher is the note. The sounds are produced precisely
as those of the Æolian harp are, the air causing in the
one case a vibration of strings, and in the other of edges
of membranes.</p>

<p><a name="P_266" id="P_266"></a>
266. <b>Harmony.</b>&mdash;When notes, on being sounded at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
same time, are agreeable to the ear, they are said to harmonize.
Now this harmony depends on a certain relation
between the vibrations. The more simple is the
relation the greater is the harmony. For example, if we
take the first note, termed the fundamental note, of what
is called the scale in music, it harmonizes better with the
octave than with any other of the eight notes, because
for every vibration in it there are just two in the octave.
Take in contrast with the octave the second note. Here
to every eight vibrations of the first note we have nine
of the second, and the consequence is a discord when
they are sounded together. The difference between the
two cases is this: In the first case the commencement
of every vibration in the fundamental note coincides with
the commencement of every second vibration in the octave.
But in the other case there is a coincidence at only
every eighth vibration of the first note with every ninth
of the second. Next to the octave, the most agreeable
harmony with the fundamental note is that of the fifth
note of the scale. Here we have three vibrations to every
two of the first note, and so every second vibration
in the first note coincides with every third vibration of
the fifth. Next comes the harmony of the fourth, there
being here a coincidence at every third vibration of the
fundamental note. The more frequent, you see, are the
coincidences between the vibrations the greater is the
harmony. In the three cases just stated the coincidence
is in the first at the commencement of <em>every</em> vibration
of the fundamental note, in the second case at the commencement
of every <em>second</em> vibration, and in the third at
the commencement of every <em>third</em> vibration.</p>

<p><a name="P_267" id="P_267"></a>
267. <b>The Diatonic Scale.</b>&mdash;In order that you may see
the relative numbers of the vibrations for each of the
notes I will give them for the whole scale. They are as
follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdc">1</td><td class="tdc"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>8</sub></td><td class="tdc"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>4</sub></td><td class="tdc"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub></td><td class="tdc"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub></td><td class="tdc"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>3</sub></td><td class="tdc"><sup>15</sup>/<sub>8</sub></td><td class="tdc">2</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">According to this the note D has nine vibrations to every
eight vibrations of C, E has five to every four of C,
etc., the octave C having just twice the number of vibrations
that the fundamental note C has. You have here
expressed the <em>proportion</em> between the numbers of vibrations
in the different notes. Suppose, then, that you
know the number of vibrations in a second that C, the
fundamental note, has, you can readily calculate the number
of vibrations of each of the other notes. It is done
by multiplying the number which C has by the fractions
over the other notes. Thus if the number of vibrations
in a second in the fundamental note be 128, by this process
we make the vibrations of all the notes to be thus:</p>

<p>There are really but seven notes in what is called the
diatonic scale, the eighth note, C, being truly the first of
seven other notes above, having relations to each other
similar to those of the notes below, and constituting another
octave. So we may have several octaves, one
above another.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the proportionate
lengths of strings required to produce the eight notes of
the scale have an exact numerical relation, but the <em>reverse</em>
of that of the numbers of the vibrations. Thus if
you have eight strings of the same size, their vibrating
lengths required for the notes are as follows:</p>

268. <b>Unison.</b>&mdash;In tuning instruments so as to make
them harmonize the result is obtained when the corresponding
parts of the instruments have the same number
of vibrations. Thus the string in one violin that gives
any particular note must vibrate just the same number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of times in a second that the strings giving the same
note in other violins do, or it will not be in perfect unison
with them. The same is true of other strings for other
notes, and also of the corresponding parts of all kinds
of instruments which are to be played together. When,
in tuning instruments together, it is said that a string
of a violin, for example, is too <em>flat</em>, the difficulty is that
it does not vibrate with sufficient rapidity, and it is therefore
screwed up to make its note <em>sharp</em> enough, as it is
expressed, to be in unison with the note of the corresponding
strings or parts of other instruments.</p>

<p><a name="P_269" id="P_269"></a>
269. <b>Mysteries of Sound and Hearing.</b>&mdash;There are
many things of a mysterious character in relation both
to sound and the manner in which it causes the sensation
of hearing. I will barely notice but two of these.
The effect, or rather the chain of effects, resulting in
hearing is wholly mechanical, until we come to the nerve
of hearing, which branches out with minute fibrils in the
halls of audience of the internal ear. It is merely a series
of vibrations. Now how it is that the mere agitation
of a fluid inclosed in hard bone can communicate
through fine white fibres to the brain, and through that
to the mind, the idea that we have of all the various
sounds that are produced, is a great mystery. All that we
know is that the nerve is the medium of the communication,
but of the manner in which it performs its office we
know absolutely nothing. Again, while it is sufficiently
mysterious that this information can thus be given to
the mind when one sound after another communicates its
vibration to the liquid in the ear, the mystery is greatly
enhanced when various sounds come to the ear at one
and the same time. To get a distinct idea of the very
compound and wonderful character of the process of
hearing in such a case we will suppose that a full band
of music is playing, and at the same time mingled with
its sounds there are various other sounds heard, some
of them perhaps discordant. What a diversity of vibra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>tions
we have here! We have the slow vibrations produced
in the grave notes, and the quick vibrations of the
higher ones, all traveling together through the air to the
ear, and each preserving its distinctive character. And
more than this, after they arrive at the ear they are
communicated unaltered through the drum, the chain of
bones, the second drum, and the liquid where the nerve
is, so that a correct report of each of all the notes is given
through the nerve to the mind. Then, too, if there
be any discord its vibration travels along with the rest,
and so do the vibrations of other sounds, as the roaring
of the wind, the report of cannon, and the noise of the
people. And besides all this, in the multiplicity of the
vibrations thus transmitted through so many different
substances the mind gets a true report of the comparative
loudness of the sounds, and even of their character,
so that the sounds of drum, fife, trumpet, etc., are all
accurately distinguished. In view of such wonders how
significant is the question, "He that planted the ear,
shall he not hear?"</p>

<p><a name="P_270" id="P_270"></a>
270. <b>Heat and Cold.</b>&mdash;In common language we speak
of heat and cold as two distinct and opposite things.
That this is not strictly correct may be shown by the
following experiment: Take three vessels, and fill the
first with ice-cold water, the second with hot water, and
the third with tepid water. If you place your right
hand in the first and the left in the second, and let them
remain a little time, on taking them out and plunging
them together into the third vessel, the water in it will
feel warm to the right hand and cold to the left. So the
air of a cellar seems warm to you in winter and cold in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
summer in contrast with the air outside. For the same
reason water of a temperature that would ordinarily be
refreshingly cool to us seems warm when drank after
eating ice-cream. It is manifest, then, that there is no
fixed dividing-line between heat and cold. There is, in
fact, no such thing as cold. Substances are cold from
being deprived of heat; and no substance ever has all its
heat taken from it. Sir Humphrey Davy proved that
there is heat in ice by rubbing two pieces together in a
very cold room. They were gradually melted. Now
this was not done by the air, for that was at a temperature
below the freezing point. The heat which melted
the ice came from the ice itself by means of the rubbing.</p>

<p><a name="P_271" id="P_271"></a>
271. <b>Nature of Heat.</b>&mdash;There are two theories in regard
to the nature of heat. One is that heat is an imponderable
(§ 16), and of course a very subtile substance,
which pervades all matter. Its particles are supposed to
repel each other strongly, and hence they have a tendency
to diffuse themselves, and to separate the particles of
matter from each other. It is in this way that they are
supposed to occasion the expansion of substances. The
other supposition, which is most commonly received, is
that heat is a vibration of the particles of bodies, and that
it passes from these to bodies less warm through a subtile
fluid called ether, supposed to fill all space. You see
that if this be the true theory, there is some analogy between
heat and sound.</p>

<p><a name="P_272" id="P_272"></a>
272. <b>Sources of Heat.</b>&mdash;The principal of the sources
of heat on our earth is the <em>sun</em>, though that body is ninety-five
millions of miles distant from us. As the heat,
in traveling all this long journey, is becoming more and
more diffused; or, in other words, as its rays are all the
way separating from each other more and more, we can
have no conception of the concentrated heat that exists
in the sun itself. We can, however, approximate to the
idea by observing the effects of heat when some of its
separated rays are gathered to a point by a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
lens, as represented in Fig.
191. A lens which concentrated
the heat ten thousand
times melted platinum,
gold, quartz, etc., in a few
seconds. And as the heat
at the sun is supposed to
be thirty times more concentrated
than this, none
of the most solid substances
of our earth would remain
solid if they were there, but
would be some of them liquid, and others even in a state
of vapor. The heat which the sun constantly radiates to
the earth pervades all substances, producing motion, and
awakening life every where, so that, in the expressive
language of the Bible, "There is nothing hid from the
heat thereof."</p>

<p>Another source of heat is <em>within the earth itself</em>. It
has been found as we go down into the earth there is a
constant increase of temperature the farther we go. This
internal heat is attributed in part to subterranean fires
and various chemical actions. We see here and there
external evidences of the operation of these causes in the
eruptions of volcanoes, the boiling springs, the jets of
steam and sulphureous vapors, etc. But that the heat in
our earth which comes from these subterranean sources
is small compared with that which comes from the sun,
is seen in the fact that the rate of increase of heat at
great depths is much less than it is nearer the surface.
This would seem to show that although fires within the
earth may have considerable influence in heating its crust,
on which we live, it derives the most of its heat from the
sun, at least to a very great depth.</p>

<p>How great a source of heat <em>electricity</em> is we know
not, but that considerable heat comes from this source
is evident from the melting and burning effect which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
we often see resulting from the passage of the electric
fluid.</p>

<p>Another very common source of heat is <em>chemical action</em>.
We see it continually produced in chemical experiments.
Combustion, which, as will be shown to you
in the Second Part of this Series, is nothing but an example
of chemical action, is the most common of all the
chemical sources of heat. Animal heat is also, for the
most part, a result of chemical action.</p>

<p><em>Mechanical action</em> is a common source of heat. The
rubbing of a match producing heat enough to occasion
flame is a familiar example. The spark produced in what
is called striking fire is the burning of a particle of steel
set on fire by the blow. The Indian was accustomed to
light his fire by the rubbing together of two dry sticks
till he learned an easier way from civilized neighbors;
and the blacksmith, previous to the invention of phosphorus
matches, often lighted his fire by touching a sulphur
match to a nail made red-hot by rapid and continued
hammering. Machinery has sometimes been set on
fire by friction, and the water around a mass of metal
has been so heated by boring as even to boil. If you
stretch a piece of India rubber several times in quick succession,
and then apply it to your lips, you will perceive
that the motion has warmed it.</p>

<p><a name="P_273" id="P_273"></a>
273. <b>Relations of Heat and Light.</b>&mdash;Heat is sometimes
alone, and is sometimes in intimate union with light. All
substances have some amount of heat, and it passes from
them to other bodies in their neighborhood that happen
to have less heat in them. In doing this it may or may
not have the company of light. In the radiation of heat
from a stove, unless it be heated to redness, there is no
light with the heat; but from an open, burning fire the
light and heat come together. But the rays of the sun
give us the best example of the union of light and heat.
Traveling together at an equal pace they are most curiously
mingled, as you will see when I come to speak particularly
of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>I will now proceed to notice the principal effects of
heat; viz., expansion, liquefaction, and vaporization.</p>

274. <b>Expansion in Solids.</b>&mdash;Heat, you have seen in
§ 23, acts in opposition to the attraction of cohesion,
tending to separate the particles, and
so produces an expansion of any substance.
This may be exemplified in
the experiment represented in Fig.
192, in which A B is an iron rod,
which is of such a size that at the
ordinary temperature it will fit into
the space, C D, in a bar of iron, and
easily pass through the hole, E. If
the rod be heated it will be enlarged
or expanded in all directions, so that
it will neither fit into C D nor pass
into the hole, E. When the wheel-wright
puts a tire upon a wheel he
uses the expansion of heat to make
it fit tightly and firmly. The tire is made a little too
small to have it fit upon the wheel as it is. But by being
heated it is so expanded that it will readily go on to
the wheel, and then in contracting as it cools it so compresses
the fellies as to hold on very tightly. Water is
poured on to cool the iron quickly, and thus prevent it
from burning the wood. Iron hoops are put on barrels
in a similar manner, the compression caused by their
contraction binding the staves together very strongly.
So in fastening the plates of boilers together, the rivets
are put in red-hot, so that in their contraction they may
press the plates closely together. If an iron gate just
shuts into its place in cold weather, its expansion will
prevent its shutting when warm weather comes. In order
to avoid this difficulty, calculation must be made in
fitting it for its place for the expansion to which it will
be subjected by heat. So in laying the rails of a railroad
in cold weather care must be taken not to put the ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
too near together. In constructing iron bridges the expansion
by heat must be calculated for in the arrangement.
Nails often become loose after the lapse of years
from the wear of the wood around them, occasioned by
their alternate expansion and contraction. The leaking
of gas-pipes in the earth is often undoubtedly caused by
the loosening of the joints from contraction and expansion
of the pipes by varying temperatures of the soil,
especially where they are not laid very deep. If a stopper
stick fast in a bottle it can be loosened by the application
around the neck of a cloth dipped in hot water,
because the neck becomes expanded at once by the heat.
A similar expedient was once very ingeniously made use
of in repairing the machinery of the steamer <i>Persia</i> at
sea, and was perhaps the means of saving the vessel and
the lives of all on board. The accident which occurred
was the breaking of the port crank-pin of the engine.
The problem to be solved was the removal of this pin,
which weighed nearly a ton, and the substitution of a
sound one which they had on hand in its place. But it
was found impossible to start the broken pin from its
socket with all the force which could be brought to bear
upon it by a sort of battering-ram constructed extemporaneously
for the purpose. It was determined now to
try the expansive force of heat. An iron platform was
built under the socket, and a brisk fire made upon it.
The socket soon expanded, and the pin was now readily
knocked out by the battering-ram, just as the stopper of
the bottle is easily removed when the neck is heated.
The walls of a very large building in Paris, which had
bulged out and were in danger of falling, were restored
to their upright position by the expansion of heat.</p>

<div class="caption">
Fig. 193.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was done in this way: Long rods of iron were run
through the walls after the plan represented in Fig. 193
(p. 213), their ends being made with a screw-thread, with
nuts fitted to them. The rods marked <em>a</em> were first heated,
and as they lengthened the nuts were screwed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
tight to the walls. On cooling, their
contraction would of course draw the
walls together. The other bars, <em>b</em>,
were now heated and managed in the
same way. The one set, you see,
were made to hold on by their nuts
to what had already been gained,
while the other were expanding. By
many repetitions of this process the
walls were righted and the building
saved. The same mode has been
adopted successfully in other cases
of a similar character.</p>

<p><a name="P_275" id="P_275"></a>
275. <b>Expansion in Liquids.</b>&mdash;Liquids
are expanded by heat more than solids are. But they are
very unequally expanded by it. Thus water is expanded
more than twice as much as mercury, and alcohol six times
as much. We have a frequent example of the expansion
of water by heat in our kitchens. If the tea-kettle be
put over the fire filled to the brim, it will run over long
before the water begins to boil. All liquids occupy
more space in summer than in winter, and in the former
case weigh less&mdash;that is, have less of real substance
in them than in the latter. If, therefore,
alcohol, or oil, or molasses be bought by the
gallon in winter and sold in summer, there will
be a profit afforded by the expansion. Twenty
gallons of alcohol in winter becomes twenty-one
in mid-summer.</p>

<div class="caption">
Fig. 194.</div>
</div>

<p>The influence of the expansion of heat upon
the specific gravity of liquids may be very prettily
shown by the following experiment: Let
some little bits of amber&mdash;a substance which
is nearly of the same specific gravity with water&mdash;be
thrown into water in a glass vessel,
and let the water be heated, as represented in
Fig. 194, by a spirit-lamp. That portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the water which is heated passes upward because it is
made specifically lighter, and colder water continually
comes down to take its place. The upward and downward
currents are as indicated by the arrows, the upward
passing up in the middle, the downward coming
down at the sides. This will be made manifest by the
little bits of amber.</p>

<p><a name="P_276" id="P_276"></a>
276. <b>Thermometers.</b>&mdash;It is the expansion of liquids by
heat that in the thermometer gives us the measure of
temperature. The liquid metal mercury is commonly
used for this purpose, and answers well except in the
extreme cold of the arctic regions. There, as mercury
becomes solid at 39 degrees below zero, it is necessary
to use a thermometer with alcohol in it, as this fluid can
not be frozen by any degree of cold. The operation of
the thermometer is simply this: Heat expands the fluid
in the bulb, and the only way in which it can occupy
more space as it expands is by rising in the tube. The
abstraction of heat, on the other hand, causes contraction,
and of course a proportionate falling of the fluid.</p>

277. <b>Fahrenheit's Thermometer.</b>&mdash;The thermometer
was invented in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
but it is not decided who was the inventor. There
may have been in this case, as in others, more inventors
than one, the same ideas having, perhaps, entered several
inquiring minds at the same time. Various fluids were
used by different persons. Sir Isaac Newton used linseed
oil. Fahrenheit, a native of Hamburg, who flourished
in the first part of the last century, was the first to
use mercury. Though various propositions were made
by Newton and others in regard to the measurement of
heat by thermometers, no thermometric scale seems to
have met with general reception till that of Fahrenheit's,
which was put forth about 1720. The plan of it is this:
His zero is the point at which the mercury stood in the
coldest freezing mixture that he could make; and he
supposed that this was the greatest possible degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
cold, as it was the greatest that he knew. He next found
the point at which the mercury stood in melting ice.
This he called the freezing point, because the temperature
is the same in water passing into the solid from the
fluid state as in water passing into the fluid state from
the solid. In other words, this point in the scale marks
the transition line between the two states. From this
point Fahrenheit marked off 32 equal
spaces or degrees down to zero. He
now found the point at which the mercury
stands in boiling water, and called
this the boiling point. Marking off the
space on the scale between this, and the
freezing point in the same manner, there
are 180 degrees&mdash;that is, the boiling point
is 212 degrees above zero. The degrees
above zero are commonly designated by
the mark +, plus; and those below by
the mark -, minus. Thus, +32° signifies
32 degrees above zero, and -32° signifies
32 degrees below.</p>

<p><a name="P_278" id="P_278"></a>
278. <b>Other Thermometers.</b>&mdash;Fahrenheit's
thermometer is the one commonly
used in this country. But there are several
other thermometers on different
scales, as the Centigrade, Reaumur's, and
De Lisle's. In Fig. 195 you see the plans
of the scales of these thermometers placed
side by side. In the Centigrade thermometer,
which is in use in France, and
indeed in a large part of Europe, the zero,
you see, is placed at the freezing point;
and the space between this and the boiling
point is divided into 100 degrees,
which gives it the name Centigrade.
Reaumur's, which is in use in Russia, has
the same zero, but he has only 80 degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
from this to the boiling point. De Lisle's, which has
gone entirely out of use, has its zero at the boiling point.
The arrangement of Fahrenheit, although its zero is a
mere arbitrary point, is, on the whole, the best, because
its degrees are of such a size that they mark differences
of temperature with sufficient minuteness for all practical
purposes of an ordinary character without resorting
to fractional parts.</p>

279. <b>Expansion in Aeriform Substances.</b>&mdash;Heat produces
a vastly greater expansive effect in air, the gases,
and vapors, than it does in liquids. The expansion of
air by heat may be shown very prettily in this way:
Take a glass tube that has
a bulb on one end, and,
placing the other open end
in water (as represented in
Fig. 196), apply the palm
of your hand to the bulb.
The heat of the hand being
communicated to the
bulb will expand the air,
and so, as you see, bubbles
of air will escape through
the water. On removing
the hand, and allowing the
bulb to cool, the air in it
will be condensed, and water
will pass up in the tube
in proportion to the amount of air which has escaped.
A bladder partly filled with air will be made to swell
out to plumpness if it be heated sufficiently, and a full
one may be so heated as to burst from the expansion of
the air. Porous wood, as chestnut, snaps very much
when burned, because the heat expands the air contained
in the pores.</p>

<p><a name="P_280" id="P_280"></a>
280. <b>Balloons.</b>&mdash;The first balloons that were used were
filled with heated air. You have already seen, in § 149,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
why it is that balloons rise. Now in the hot-air balloon
it is the expansion of the air by heat that makes it lighter
than the surrounding air. Of course such a balloon
is not as effective as the gas balloon, for the air within it
loses its comparative lightness as it becomes cooled;
while the gas which is used, being very much lighter
than air at the same temperature, does not lose its lightness
as the balloon goes up. You learned in § 152 that
the atmosphere becomes thinner as we go upward. The
gas balloon, therefore, rises until it arrives at that point
where the air is of about the same specific gravity with
the gas, and there it stops. It is made to descend by
letting out some of the gas from a valve. Gas was not
used for balloons till 1782. Hydrogen gas was employed
at first, being over fourteen times lighter than air. Of
late the common burning gas, carbureted hydrogen, has
been generally used, because it can be so readily obtained
where there are gas-works.</p>

<p><a name="P_281" id="P_281"></a>
281. <b>Currents in the Air from Heat.</b>&mdash;Heat is the
grand mover of the atmosphere. Any portion of it that
becomes warmer than surrounding portions rises, or rather
is pushed up, for the same reason that a hot-air balloon
rises, the only difference between the two cases being
that in the one the air is confined, and in the other
is left free, and so becomes diffused. And it is this rising
of the air from expansion that causes nearly all the
movements that we witness in the air. We see this exemplified
in various ways wherever there is a fire. The
air that is heated by the fire is forced upward by the
colder air, which, on the principles of specific gravity,
seeks to get below the warmer and lighter air. The hot
air that comes through the registers of a furnace is pushed
up by colder air below. For the same reason the
heated air around a stove-pipe is constantly going upward.
This is very prettily shown by the toy represented
in Fig. 197 (p. 218), which is a paper cut spirally, and
suspended, as you see, upon the point of a wire. The up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ward
current makes the paper revolve
rapidly around the wire. It is from the
rising of warm air that the galleries of
a church are warmer than the space below.
In a common room the disposition
of the air is continually to have its
warmest portions above and the colder
below. It is for this reason that we
have our arrangements for producing
or introducing heat at as low a point as
possible.</p>

282. <b>Chimneys.</b>&mdash;We speak of the <em>draught</em> of a chimney,
and we say of one that does not smoke that it <em>draws</em>
well, as if the smoke were in some way actually drawn
up. But the same principles apply here as are developed
in § 281. The smoke, which is a combination of
heated air and gases with some solid matters in a fine
state, is <em>forced</em> up the chimney. When a chimney does
not draw well we open a door or a window for a little
while until the fire gets thoroughly agoing. Why is this?
It is that we may have denser air than there is in the
room, so that the smoke may be pushed up more forcibly.
When the chimney becomes well heated there is
ordinarily no difficulty, because then the smoke in it is
not obliged to part with much of its heat to the walls of
the chimney, and therefore is so much lighter than the
air in the room that it is very easily forced upward. The
principal reason that a stove-pipe generally draws better
than a chimney is that there is much less heat expended
in establishing and maintaining the upward current. Especially
is this true if the chimney be a large one. In
such a case there are both a great extent of brick and a
large body of air to be heated to establish the upward
current, and these must be kept warm in order to maintain
it.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

283. <b>Winds.</b>&mdash;If you open a door of a heated room a
candle held near the floor will have its flame blown inward,
while one held near the top of the door will have
its flame blown toward the cold entry. Here you have
a good illustration of the manner in which winds are
produced. Wherever the wind blows it is air pushing
out of the way other air that is warmer, in order that it
may, in obedience to gravitation, get as near the earth
as possible. Take, for example, the land and sea breezes,
as they are called. During a hot summer's day the sun
heats the earth powerfully, while the ocean receives but
little of its heat. The heated land heats the air above it;
and as the air over the ocean is cooler, and therefore
heavier, it pushes upward the air of the land, for the
same reason that water pushes up oil; and as this goes
on continuously a regular current is established. The
wind blows in upon the land, as represented in Fig. 198,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
while the warmer air passes upward into the higher regions
of the atmosphere, and turns toward the sea. The
arrows show the course of the currents. The resemblance
of all this to the effect upon the candle held near
the open door is very obvious, the cold air from the entry
blowing in below representing the breeze from the
ocean, and the warm air of the room blowing out above
representing the passage of the warm air of the land out
toward the ocean. At night this is apt to be reversed.
The earth becomes cooled, and with it the air that is over
it. The result is that the cooled air of the land now
pushes upward the warmer air of the sea, as seen in
Fig. 199.</p>

284. <b>Winds as Affected by the Rotation of the Earth.</b>&mdash;The
heat of the vertical sun upon the tropics causes a
rise of heated air into the upper regions, while there is
a rush of colder air toward the equator from both north
and south. This effect is represented in Fig. 200 (p. 221),
E being the sun, N the north pole, and S the south pole.
An effect similar to that represented in Figs. 198 and
199 is produced here, but it is on a much larger scale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
But the diagram does not present the matter in its true
light in all respects. The prevailing winds in the equatorial
regions are not north and south winds, as would
appear from this diagram; but they are from the northeast
and southeast. I will
explain this by Fig. 201.
As the earth turns on its
axis it is plain that there is
no part of the surface of
the earth that moves so
rapidly as the equator,
E W, for that moves in a
larger circle than any other
part. And the nearer you
go to either pole, N or S,
the less is the rapidity of
the revolution. Now the
atmosphere, as stated in § 188, partakes of the motion
of the earth. The air, therefore, at the equator is moving
from west to east with the rotation of the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
faster than it is any where else, and the nearer you go
to either pole the slower is its motion. It follows from
this that any portion of air blowing from the north or
the south toward the equator, as it comes from where it
was moving east slower than air at the equator is, would
from its lesser momentum lag behind the air of the
equator, the wind would be curved toward the westward,
as indicated by the arrows. The result would be
that the northern wind would be converted into a northeaster,
and the southern into a southeaster. All this
can be made more clear with a globe, or, indeed, with
any round object.</p>

<p><a name="P_285" id="P_285"></a>
285. <b>Liquefaction.</b>&mdash;The change of solids into liquids
is one of the most observable effects of heat. This
change requires different degrees of heat in different
substances. Thus while iron melts at the high heat of
2786°, lead melts at 633°, sulphur at 239°, ice at 32°, and
mercury at 39° below zero. Mercury is never found in
a solid state, but it sometimes becomes solid in the arctic
regions when carried there and exposed in the open air.
We are apt to think of water as being in a more natural
state when liquid than when it is solid, just as we think
of iron as being naturally solid and mercury as naturally
liquid. But in all these cases the state of the substance
depends on its temperature, and this is varied by circumstances.
Water at the equator is always liquid, and the
idea of ice there is exceedingly unnatural; while near
the poles it is the reverse, ice and snow reigning every
where throughout the whole year.</p>

<p><a name="P_286" id="P_286"></a>
286. <b>Evaporation.</b>&mdash;There are two ways in which the
change of a liquid into a vapor occurs. One is a rapid
change when heat is so applied as to raise the liquid to
its boiling point. This is commonly termed vaporization.
The other mode is the ordinary gradual evaporation
which goes on from the <em>surface</em> of the liquid. This process
is going on continuously, not requiring any particular
degree of heat, but occurring under all degrees of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the temperature of a liquid. Its rapidity, however, is
in proportion to the degree of heat, as may be seen by
the rise of vapor from water that is being heated, long
before it begins to boil. The same thing can also be
seen in a bright summer's morning, when the heat of the
sun causes the moisture gathered from rain or dew to
rise so abundantly from fences, and boards, and roofs as
to be visible like smoke.</p>

<p><a name="P_287" id="P_287"></a>
287. <b>Solution of Water in Air.</b>&mdash;Evaporation is constantly
going on from every wet surface, except when
the air is so loaded with moisture that it can take up no
more. The vapor is not ordinarily visible, the particles
of water passing quietly upward among those of the air,
being dissolved in the air just as some solids are dissolved
in water. It becomes visible only when so much
of it rises that the solution of the water in the air is not
readily effected. The readiness with which the solution
takes place depends much upon the temperature of the
atmosphere. Some very common phenomena illustrate
this. In a very cold day the breath of animals, as it
comes out of the mouth, seems to be loaded with moisture.
Why? It is not because there is more moisture
in it than in warm weather, but because cold air can not
hold in solution so much water as warm air can. The
same explanation applies to the smoking of wet fences
and roofs in the sun of a summer's morning. The moisture
is heated by the sun, but the air, not having become
very warm as yet, can not readily dissolve all the moisture
that rises. The phenomenon is not apt to occur
when the hot sun shines after a shower at mid-day or in
the afternoon, because then the air is warm enough to
take up all the moisture that is sent up into it.</p>

<p>How water, being heavier than air, rises in the atmosphere
is a mystery. It has been supposed by some that
it was owing to a kind of affinity existing between water
and air. But in opposition to this is the fact that evaporation
takes place more rapidly under the exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
receiver of an air-pump, where there is almost no air,
than it does where it is freely exposed to the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a name="P_288" id="P_288"></a>
288. <b>Clouds.</b>&mdash;The water which goes up in the air in
evaporation is variously disposed of. Some of it is deposited
as dew or frost. Some of it forms fog. Some
of it also mounts far upward and forms the clouds, which
are really collections of fog made high up in the air. In
fog and in clouds the water which in its evaporation is
invisible becomes visible. Let us see how this is. There
is always more or less of water in clear air, but the particles
are so minutely divided and so thoroughly mingled
with the particles of the air that they can not be seen.
But in a fog or cloud the particles of water are gathered
together in little companies, as we may express it. And
it is supposed, some think ascertained, that each of these
companies of particles is globular and hollow. If so,
then we may regard every cloud as a vast collection of
minute bubbles or balloons careering through the air.</p>

289. <b>Shapes of Clouds.</b>&mdash;Clouds have a very great variety
of shape, the causes of which are for the most part
not understood. They are generally divided into four
classes: Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, and Nimbus. The
<em>Cirrus</em> is represented in Fig. 202 (p. 225). It is a light,
fleecy cloud, having graceful turns like curls, and hence
its name, which is the Latin word for curl. Such clouds
are commonly very high up in the air. The <em>Cumulus</em>
(Latin for heap) you see in Fig. 203 (p. 225). Clouds
taking this form appear as heaps rounded upward, and
often appear like mountains of snow when they are illuminated
by the sun. We see such clouds mostly in
summer. The <em>Stratus</em> (Latin for covering) is seen in the
same figure under the Cumulus. Clouds of this form lie
low in the horizon, stretched along like a sheet. They
often form in the latter part of the day, and increase in
the night, but the rising sun dissipates them. The <em>Nimbus</em>,
or rain-cloud, is represented in Fig. 204 (p. 226).
It has a uniform gray or dark color. We often have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
two forms of cloud mingled together. Thus in Fig. 205
(p. 226) we have a mixture of the Stratus and the Cirrus,
termed <em>Cirro-Stratus</em>. This is commonly called the
mackerel-sky, and is quite a sure prognostic of rain.
Then we have the <em>Cirro-Cumulus</em>, Fig. 206 (p. 227), and
the <em>Cumulo-Stratus</em>, Fig. 207 (p. 227).</p>

<p>Water is gathered into clouds undoubtedly, in part at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
least, from the influence of attraction. But what the
circumstances are that give them all these various shapes
we know not. Whatever they are, they sometimes operate
very extensively, giving a similar shape to all the
clouds that cover the whole arch of the heavens; and at
other times they operate variously in different localities,
producing different shapes, sometimes even in near neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>borhood
to each other. Sometimes the edge of a cloud
is irregular, or curved, or feathery; and at others it is a
well-defined line, stretching along over a large portion
of the horizon. In all these cases we have only divers
arrangements of the same thing&mdash;a collection of vesicles
of water containing air, which is made lighter than the
air outside of the cloud by means which I shall speak of
in another part of this chapter.</p>

290. <b>Rain, Snow, and Hail.</b>&mdash;When it rains the vesicles
or minute bubbles of which the clouds are composed
are broken up, and each drop of rain contains the water
which came from a multitude of these vesicles. But let
us see exactly how this result is produced. Rain comes
from the contraction of the clouds by cold. A cold current
of air coming in contact with a cloud will condense
its bubbles into drops, and these of course will fall. The
same result occurs if a cloud passes into a cold stratum
of air. But let us look at the process more minutely.
Let us see what the effect of cold is upon the bubbles.
The first effect may be made clear by Fig.
208. If a bubble be contracted by the influence
of cold, the water of its wall being
made thicker, there will be a gathering of
it from gravitation at the lower part, as
represented by the dotted line. You often
see a similar effect in the soap-bubble. It
rises filled with the warm air from your lungs, and as it
goes up it is contracted by the colder air which is around
it. This contraction makes the water hang downward
from the bottom of it. And as the soap-bubble at length
perhaps bursts in the air from the weight of this water,
so it is with the vesicles in the cloud. And many of
these, united together by attraction, form a drop. When
the cold is sufficiently severe it makes the water of the
ruptured vesicles of the cloud arrange itself in snow-crystals
instead of drops. And when the cold acts with great
rapidity upon a cloud it presses the particles of the water
together so suddenly that there is not time for the crystalline
arrangement, and hail is formed.</p>

<p><a name="P_291" id="P_291"></a>
291. <b>Vaporization.</b>&mdash;The production of vapor by boiling
differs in some respects from quiet evaporation. Here
the liquid is raised in temperature to its boiling point,
and the formation of vapor is not confined to the surface.
In water the boiling point is 212°, but it varies more or
less from this in other liquids. Thus the boiling point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of alcohol is 173°, of ether 95°, oil of turpentine 568°,
and mercury 652°.</p>

<p><a name="P_292" id="P_292"></a>
292. <b>Influence of Pressure upon the Formation of Vapor.</b>&mdash;Pressure
restrains the production of vapor, whether
it be formed by evaporation or vaporization. We
know by experiments with the air-pump that the less
pressure of air there is upon the surface of a liquid the
more rapidly will evaporation from it go on. I have already
spoken of the influence of pressure upon the boiling
of liquids in § 171. I will give here a few additional
illustrations. Ether boils when it is heated to 95°, three
degrees below the heat of the blood in our bodies. If
we place some of it in a vessel under the receiver of an
air-pump, by exhausting the air we can so take off the
pressure that the ether will boil at the ordinary temperature
of the air in a room. The restraint of pressure
upon boiling is very strikingly shown in the <em>digester</em>,
Fig. 209. This is a strong boiler, <em>a</em>, partly
filled with water. A thermometer, <em>d</em>,
is fastened into it so as to indicate the
heat of the water. There is also a tube,
<em>c</em>, extending to near the bottom of the
boiler into a small quantity of mercury
which is there. Let, now, the boiler be
heated till the water boils, the air being
left to escape by the stop-cock, <em>b</em>. If the
stop-cock be shut, and we continue to apply
the heat, we can raise the water to a
very high temperature without having it boil at all, because
of the pressure of the condensed steam upon its
surface. An apparatus somewhat after this plan, called
<em>Papin's digester</em>, has been used sometimes in cooking.
The great heat to which water can thus be raised causes
it to extract the nutritious matter from bones and cartilages,
affording material for soup from what is commonly
thrown away. To guard against the danger of explosion
a safety-valve is provided, having a weight upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
which will keep it shut until a certain amount of pressure
accumulates, and then it is forced open, letting out
some of the steam.</p>

<p><a name="P_293" id="P_293"></a>
293. <b>Steam.</b>&mdash;The cloud of steam, so called, which you
so often see escaping from a locomotive is not really
steam. Steam is transparent and invisible. You can see
that it is so if you observe it issuing from the spout of a
tea-kettle. It is only after it gets an inch or more from
the spout that it becomes visible, and then it is really
changed from steam into water by the condensing influence
of the cold air. And the water in the cloud thus
formed is probably in the same condition with the water
in the clouds above, as described in § 288.</p>

<p><a name="P_294" id="P_294"></a>
294. <b>The Steam-Engine.</b>&mdash;As compressed or condensed
air has great power by its elasticity, as seen in the air-gun,
§ 164, so also has condensed steam. It is steam
condensed, and endeavoring, therefore, in proportion to
its condensation, to expand itself, which constitutes the
moving force of the steam-engine. The steam is generated
in a boiler, having, like the boiler of Papin's digester,
a valve with a weight attached to it. This valve is
called a safety-valve, because when the steam has reached
a certain degree of condensation it lifts the valve,
and, as some of the steam escapes, such an increase of
pressure as would occasion an explosion is prevented.
The expansive force of steam in a boiler is estimated in
pounds by the weight on the valve, and hence the common
expression that there are so many pounds of steam
on. But the boiler is only the generator of steam, and
it remains to show how the steam is used in moving machinery.
This is done by allowing the steam to pass
from the boiler into a cylinder, and then move a piston
back and forth by its expansive force. The manner in
which it does this may be made clear by the diagram,
Fig. 210 (p. 231). Let <em>e</em> be a piston in a cylinder, <em>f</em>,
which has four openings, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em>. These all have
valves. The steam is supplied from the boiler to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
cylinder through <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>, and makes its escape
from <em>b</em> and <em>d</em>. Suppose, now, the piston is near
the bottom of the cylinder, as represented.
The valve at <em>a</em> is now opened that steam may
enter to push up the piston, and the valve at <em>b</em>
shuts that the steam may not escape. At the
same time, that pressure may be taken off from
the upper surface of the piston, <em>d</em> opens that the
steam may escape, and <em>c</em> shuts that none may
enter. When the piston is to be forced downward
all this is reversed&mdash;<em>c</em> opens to admit the
steam, <em>d</em> shuts to prevent its escaping; and below,
<em>b</em> is opened to let the steam escape, and <em>a</em>
is shut to prevent any from entering. This is
the plan of what is called the high-pressure engine.
The low-pressure engine differs from it in having
the steam, as it escapes from the cylinder, pass
into water to be condensed. The latter requires less
pressure of steam to work it, and therefore is the safest.
The manner in which the motion of the piston is made
to work various kinds of machinery I need not stop to
explain, especially as exemplifications of it may be seen
in every quarter.</p>

<p><a name="P_295" id="P_295"></a>
295. <b>Communication of Heat.</b>&mdash;Heat has a constant
tendency to an equilibrium. If therefore any warm substance
be in the neighborhood of one which has less heat,
a flow of heat from the former toward the latter takes
place. Now this communication of heat occurs in three
different ways, called Convection, Conduction, and Radiation.
I will speak of each of these separately.</p>

<p><a name="P_296" id="P_296"></a>
296. <b>Convection.</b>&mdash;This mode of diffusion of heat is in
operation in those substances whose particles are movable
among each other&mdash;viz., liquids and aeriform substances.
I have already alluded to examples of this mode in
speaking of the movements which heat causes in these
substances. The heat goes along with the particles
which are moved, or is <em>conveyed</em> along with them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
hence the term convection. In this movement the heated
particles always ascend, for the reason given in § 275.
Of the multitude of examples of convection I will present
but a few.</p>

<p>In the upward current about a stove-pipe you have an
example of convection, the heat generated being carried
upward by the particles of this current. This being so,
the heat of a stove has no effect upon the air <em>below</em> it by
convection, though it does have by radiation, as you will
soon see. Any hot fluid becomes cool chiefly by convection.
The air coming in contact with it taking some
of its heat rises, and other air comes in its turn to be
also heated, and so on till the fluid becomes of the same
temperature with the air, and then the currents of air
cease. The liquid cools more rapidly by stirring it, because
the air is brought into contact with a greater extent
of surface, and so the heat is conveyed away more
rapidly. The result is the same whether we disturb the
surface by stirring it or by blowing upon it. In the latter
case, however, the effect is increased by making the
air to come more rapidly upon the disturbed surface. So
in fanning, it is the bringing of the air faster upon the
surface of the body that causes the more rapid, convection
of heat from it. Every one must have observed the
fact that a buckwheat cake cools much more quickly
than a flour or rice cake. It is because it has so many
pores and little projections, and so presents a much larger
amount of surface to the heat-conveying air than the
smoother and more solid cakes. Viscid fluids, as molasses,
oil, etc., when heated do not cool as readily as water,
because their particles are not as movable, and therefore
heat is not conveyed as rapidly upward to be given
off to the air.</p>

<p><a name="P_297" id="P_297"></a>
297. <b>Conduction.</b>&mdash;In this mode of diffusion the heat
goes through or among the particles of substances. For
example, if one end of a bar of iron be held in the fire, it
travels through or among the particles to the other end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
The gradual progress of the heat may be seen by the
following simple experiment: Take a rod of iron and attach
to it, as seen in
Fig. 211, some little
balls of wood by means
of wax. By heating
one end with a lamp the balls will drop one after another
as the heat passing along melts the wax which
holds them.</p>

298. <b>Conductors and Non-Conductors.</b>&mdash;Heat is conducted
more rapidly through some substances than
through others. There is great variety in this respect.
There is considerable among those which are reckoned
as good conductors, as is shown
by the experiment represented
in Fig. 212. Here are cones
of the same size of seven different
substances&mdash;copper, iron,
zinc, tin, lead, marble, and brick&mdash;all
tipped with a little wax,
and placed on a stove. The
wax will melt on the copper
cone first, showing that this is
the best conductor of them all;
and on the brick one last, showing
that this is the poorest conductor.
The conducting powers of the rest are according
to the order in which I have mentioned them.</p>

<p>Those substances which allow heat to pass through
them very slowly are called non-conductors. The term,
though convenient, is not a strictly correct one, for there
are no substances which do not conduct heat in some degree.
Wood is one of these poor conductors, and hence
wooden handles are put upon various instruments and
vessels that are used about fires, as the soldering irons
of the tinman, the metallic tea-pot, etc. As cloth is a
non-conductor, the holder is used in taking off the tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>-kettle
and in using the flat-iron. Glass is so poor a conductor
that if you hold a rod or tube of it across the
flame of a spirit lamp or gas burner, and heat it even to
redness, you can place your fingers very near to the heated
portion with impunity. I had occasion to-day to bend
a small glass tube in this way, and I observed some water
in it quite near to the heated part which remained
undisturbed through the process. It is the non-conducting
quality of glass that makes it so liable to break, when
it is thick, if it be exposed to any sudden change of temperature.
For example, if hot water be poured into a
thick glass vessel, the inner surface is quickly expanded;
but the outer surface not expanding with it, because the
heat is not readily conducted through, this irregularity
in expansion causes a fracture. It is for this reason that
the flasks, retorts, etc., used by the chemist are made
very thin, especially where the heat is to be applied.</p>

299. <b>Davy's Safety-Lamp.</b>&mdash;One of the most beautiful
applications of the conduction of heat we have in the
Safety-Lamp of Sir Humphrey Davy, an
invention which has been the means of
saving the lives of multitudes of miners.
It is represented in Fig. 213. With this
lamp one can go into the midst of the most
explosive gases with impunity. Now all
that prevents the flame within from setting
on fire the gases without is a covering
of wire-gauze. This, being a good
conductor, conducts off the heat of the
flame within so rapidly that it can not go
through the openings <em>as flame</em>, and so
does not set fire to the gas without. The
fact upon which the construction of this
lamp was based was discovered by trying
many experiments. Among them were
the following: A piece of wire-gauze was held over a
candle so that its flame struck against it. The smoke is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>sued
above, but no flame. Then a stream
of gas was allowed to pass through the
gauze, as seen in Fig. 214, and was set
on fire above. It burned without inflaming
the gas below.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

300. <b>Relation of Density to Conduction.</b>&mdash;Generally
the more dense a substance
is the better is its conduction of
heat. Thus the metals are better conductors
than wood, marble than brick,
the solids than liquids, and liquids than aeriform substances.
We have frequently a good illustration of the difference
between stone and brick as conductors in the
melting of snow on sidewalks. If a light snow fall in
the spring, after the earth has become somewhat warm,
you will see it melted from the stone walks much before
it is from the brick ones. This will be especially the
case if the snow be melted mostly by the warmth of the
earth without the agency of the sun. The explanation
is obvious. The stone is a better conductor than the
brick, and therefore the heat of the earth comes up
through the former more rapidly than through the latter.</p>

301. <b>Conduction in Liquids.</b>&mdash;That liquids are poor
conductors of heat may be shown by an experiment or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>two. If a thin glass tube closed at one end be filled with
water, and the heat of a spirit lamp be applied
to its upper portion, as seen in Fig.
215, though the water at this portion may
be made to boil, there will not be the least
movement in the lower part. This will be
very obvious if you have some amber-dust
in the water. Again, let a little water be
frozen in the lower part of the tube by placing it in a
freezing mixture, and introduce a little oil, and then over
that some alcohol. Hold now the
tube over the chimney of a lamp, as
represented in Fig. 216, until the alcohol
boils. The ice in the bottom
of the tube will not be in the least affected,
and the oil will be but slightly
heated. If the heat were to be applied
in either of the above cases at
the lower part of the tube the result
would be different, because convection
would then operate in the diffusion of the heat.</p>

<p><a name="P_302" id="P_302"></a>
302. <b>Air as a Non-Conductor.</b>&mdash;Heat is rapidly diffused
in air by convection; but it is only when the air is free
that this can be done. When the air is confined in spaces
or pores, or among fibres, heat makes its way through it
very slowly, for it can be diffused through it then only
by conduction. The variety of ways in which air is of
service to us as a non-conductor is almost endless. I
will notice some of them.</p>

<p><a name="P_303" id="P_303"></a>
303. <b>Double Windows.</b>&mdash;The efficacy of double windows
depends upon the confined air between them. In
the case of the single window a great deal of the heat
inside is lost in this way: The warm air of the room
which comes in contact with the window imparts to it
some of its heat, and, being thus cooled and therefore
condensed, passes downward. As this process goes on
continually this downward current by the window is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
constant. The current outside is in the opposite direction.
The heat imparted to the window is taken up by
the cold air, and as it thus becomes warmer it passes upward.
And this upward current outside is as constant
as the downward current inside. Now nearly all this is
prevented by the non-conducting quality of confined air
in the case of double windows. If a pane were taken
out from the upper part of the inner window, and another
from its lower part, the inner window would be of
little use, for then the heat of the air in the room would
be continually diminished by convection, as when the
window is single. The warm air would pass in at the
upper opening, and, being cooled, pass down through
the lower one.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><a name="P_304" id="P_304"></a>
304. <b>Air as a Non-Conductor in the Walls of Buildings.</b>&mdash;The
spaces included between the outer wall of a building
and the plastering inside being filled with confined
air, prevent the heat of the air in the apartments from
passing off readily through the wall. A house built of
brick or stone, with the plastering placed directly upon
the inside of the wall, would be kept warm with difficulty
in winter, because the solid wall would so readily
conduct off the heat to the external air. So, also, such
a house would be very warm in summer, because the
heat of the sun and of the external air would be so
rapidly communicated to the air of the house. In this
connection I will mention a contrivance to prevent the
spreading of fires in blocks of buildings, which, though
very effectual, is seldom made use of, partly because it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>occasions some trouble and expense, and partly because
it takes up a little room. It is this: A small space is
left in the division wall between each two houses from
top to bottom, containing, of course, a body of confined
air, that is, if the space be entirely shut in, which is as
essential here as in the case of the double windows.
With such an arrangement the interior of one house may
be entirely consumed without communicating sufficient
heat through the confined air to set on fire the other.</p>

<p><a name="P_305" id="P_305"></a>
305. <b>Fur, Hair, and Feathers.</b>&mdash;Animals that live in
cold climates are provided with suitable coverings for
their protection. Quadrupeds, for example, are covered
with fur, and birds have an abundance of downy feathers.
These coverings have no warmth in themselves,
though in common language we speak of them as being
warm. They are simply non-conductors, and so prevent
the heat which is made in the body of the animal from
escaping as fast as it otherwise would. But why are
they non-conductors? It is not because the substance
of which they are made is a non-conductor, but because
among their numberless fibres is partially confined that
great non-conductor, air. Let the fur or down be condensed
into a thin hard plate upon the animal, and it
would prove of little service as a protection against cold.
Down is much more abundant on the birds of cold climates
than on those in warmer regions, because more
air can be confined among the fibres of down than among
those of common feathers. Quadrupeds that are natives
of warm climates generally have hair instead of fur.
When therefore the horse is taken to a cold climate he
requires in winter the defense of a blanket; and the ox
needs under the same circumstances to be better housed
than he ordinarily is. As the elephant is a native of a
climate positively hot, his hairs are scanty and coarse.
Formerly there were elephants in the cold regions of
Siberia, as has been ascertained by remains found there.
But the elephant of Siberia had under its hair, close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the skin, a fine wool to protect it against the cold. Animals
that live in cold climates have their coverings become
finer in fibre in the cold season of the year, to give
them the additional protection which they then need.
And animals with a furry covering, if they are carried
into a warm climate, have their fur become coarse, and
approximate the condition of hair.</p>

<p><a name="P_306" id="P_306"></a>
306. <b>Clothing.</b>&mdash;Man has no covering to guard him
against cold, because he is capable of contriving clothing
suitable to the various degrees of temperature to which
he may be exposed. The object of clothing is not to
make the body warm, but to keep it so. The heat of
the body is generated continually within itself, and under
all circumstances this heat is maintained quite uniformly
at 98°. This, you see, is a much higher degree than the
atmosphere ordinarily has. We are all the time, then,
giving off heat to the air around us, except when the air
gets up to 98°. We are comfortable only when we are
giving off heat to a considerable amount, for the point
of temperature which is most agreeable to us when we
are at rest is 70° or a little less, that is nearly thirty degrees
below the temperature of our bodies. When the
temperature is below this we need extra clothing. In
making choice of clothing for various degrees of temperature
we practically apply the principles which I have
developed. Those articles of clothing which can confine
or entangle, as we may say, the largest quantity of air
among their fibres are the best non-conductors, or, in
common language, are the warmest. So, too, loose clothing
is warmer than tight, on account of the amount of
air between the clothing and the body. Thus a loose
glove is much warmer than a tight one. The same general
fact is exemplified in the coatings of straw which
we put upon tender trees and shrubs in winter. It is
the air that is confined in the tubes of the straw which
makes these coverings so effective a defense. It is probably
the air in the pores of the brick which makes it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
poorer conductor than stone, as illustrated by the fact
stated in § 300.</p>

<p><a name="P_307" id="P_307"></a>
307. <b>Cocoons.</b>&mdash;Many insects pass through their pupa
or transition state in cocoons. When this is done during
warm weather, as in the case of the silk-worm, the
cocoon is simple. But when the pupa state lasts through
the winter special provisions are made in the arrangements
of the cocoon to guard the insect against the cold.
I will cite as an example the cocoon of one of our largest
moths, the Cecropia. This cocoon, fastened to some
shrub, keeps its inmate secure from the rigors of the
winter by a very beautiful arrangement. The real cocoon
is similar to that of the silk-worm; but it has a very
dense air-tight outer covering, and the space between
these two coverings of the pupa is filled with a loose
substance, which has air, of course, mingled with its
fibres, and acts, therefore, the part of a blanket for the
insect.</p>

<p><a name="P_308" id="P_308"></a>
308. <b>Buds of Plants in Winter.</b>&mdash;In the latter part of
summer buds are formed on trees and shrubs, and these
contain the germs of the branches, leaves, and flowers
which are to come out the next year. These of course
must be guarded against the cold of winter, and it is
done very much as the pupa is guarded in the cocoon.
Each bud you can see has a covering of scales which is
air-tight, and inside of this there is a soft downy substance,
the blanketing of the bud. In these coverings,
which have been called by some one the "winter-cradles"
of the buds, the infant vegetation of another year
rocks back and forth in the wintry winds secure from
the cold, till the warm sun of spring wakes its hidden
life into activity.</p>

<p><a name="P_309" id="P_309"></a>
309. <b>Snow a Protection to Plants.</b>&mdash;Snow is a good
blanket to the earth, keeping its warmth from escaping
into the cold air. This is because it contains mingled
with its feathery crystals such a quantity of air. If snow
come early, before the ground and the plants in it have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
become frozen, it will keep them from freezing through
the winter, if it remain during all that time. It is curious
to observe the peculiar arrangement of the snow in
the arctic regions for the preservation of vegetation.
First in the autumn come soft light snows covering up
the grasses, and heaths, and willows. Then as winter
advances there are laid on top of these the denser snows,
making a compact, stout roof over the lighter snows in
which the scanty but precious vegetation of those regions
is imbedded. On top of this roof are deposited the snows
of spring. As these melt the water runs off from the icy
roof down the slopes, leaving untouched the plants underneath,
which lie there alike secure from the rush of
waters and from the nightly frosts until the season is
sufficiently advanced to bring them out with safety from
their concealment. Then the icy roof melts, and with it
the light snows that have so long encircled the plants,
and the sun wakes them from their long sleep to a new
life.</p>

<p><a name="P_310" id="P_310"></a>
310. <b>Influence of the Conduction of Heat on Sensation.</b>&mdash;If
you place your hand upon fur hanging at the door
of a fur-store it does not feel as cold as the wood from
which it hangs, and the wood does not feel so cold as
the iron bar of the shutter close by. Why is this, when
these substances are exposed to the same atmosphere,
and really have the same temperature? It is because
the iron conducts the heat from your hand more readily
than the wood, and the wood more readily than the fur.
So the iron handle of a wooden pump feels colder than
the pump, and the pump colder than the snow around it.
For the same reason, in a cold room the rug or the carpet
will not feel as cold as the poker and the hearth.
If water has stood long enough in a room to be of the
same temperature with the air of the room your hand
will feel colder in the water than in the air, because the
water is the better conductor. So much for the sensation
of <em>cold</em>. On the other hand, when substances are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
so heated as to give us the sensation of heat, the conductors
do this more than the non-conductors. As they
receive heat readily they also readily impart it. For this
reason, with a brisk fire the hearth-stone feels very hot,
while the rug before the fire does not.</p>

<p><a name="P_311" id="P_311"></a>
311. <b>Radiation of Heat.</b>&mdash;Every substance sends heat
into space constantly in straight lines in every direction.
These lines are radii, and hence the term radiation is applied
to heat diffused in this way. It is very obvious in
regard to the sun that it radiates heat in all directions.
The same can be seen in the case of a heated iron ball.
In whatever direction you hold your hand, above, below,
or laterally, you feel the heat. And it makes no difference
whether the ball be red-hot or not. That is, heat
is radiated either with or without light. When a room
is warmed by a furnace it is warmed altogether by convection;
but when it is warmed by a fire, either in a fire-place
or a stove, we have both convection and radiation.
The heat which we receive from the sun comes altogether
by radiation.</p>

<p><a name="P_312" id="P_312"></a>
312. <b>Connection between Heat and Light.</b>&mdash;The heat
and light of the sun pass together through transparent
substances, as air, glass, water, etc., without heating them
to any extent. Thus, when the heat is transmitted
through a lens, § 272, the lens is little heated, that is, it
lets almost all the heat pass through it. The air is heated
by the sun, but not directly to any amount. It is
heated indirectly in this way: the rays of the sun passing
through the air heat the earth, and then the air receives
a part of this heat from the earth, which is diffused
through it by convection.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with heat that comes from a common
fire. It does not seem to be so thoroughly united with
the light, and therefore readily parts company with it,
as we may say. While the heat and light of the sun go
together through all transparent bodies the heat of a fire
will not go with its light through all of them. So while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the heat of the sun does not warm the glass through
which it passes the heat of a fire will warm it, and therefore
glass is an effectual screen against it. In some operations
in the arts a mask of glass is sometimes worn to
ward off the heat. The connection of light and heat will
be farther noticed when I come to treat of light.</p>

<p><a name="P_313" id="P_313"></a>
313. <b>Relation between Radiation and Absorption.</b>&mdash;All
surfaces that radiate will absorb also equally well
the heat that is radiated upon them. All rough and
dark surfaces both absorb and radiate freely; but all
light-colored and polished surfaces do both slowly. For
this reason the black, rough tea-kettle is well fitted to
heat water in; but it is not fitted to retain the heat in
the water. On the other hand, the bright, polished tea-pot
absorbs heat poorly, but retains it well.</p>

314. <b>Reflection of Heat.</b>&mdash;Radiated heat is reflected;
and here, as in the case of motion, § 206, and of sound,
§ 260, the angles of incidence and reflection are equal.
Some interesting experiments in relation to the reflection
of heat can be tried with concave metallic mirrors.
Thus, if we take two such mirrors, as represented in Fig.
217, and place in the focus of one a thermometer, and
in the focus of the other a small flask of hot water, or a
heated iron ball, the mercury in the thermometer will
rise, although the mirrors may be many feet apart. Observe
how the effect is produced. Rays of heat go from
the flask directly toward the thermometer, as represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>ed
by the lines in the figure; but that the effect does not
come from these can be proved by removing the mirrors,
leaving the flask and thermometer just as they are.
When the experiment is tried in this way no effect is
produced on the thermometer, because it is too far from
the source of heat, the flask, to receive any perceptible
influence in this way. The effect comes from the rays
of heat which go to the mirror near the flask, and are
reflected to the other mirror, and then are reflected upon
the thermometer, all of which is represented by the dotted
lines. There is another way, besides that already
mentioned, of showing that it is not the <em>direct</em> rays that
produce the effect. After arranging the apparatus put a
screen between the thermometer and the mirror near it,
and the effect will be prevented because the reflection is
cut off. If a piece of ice be substituted for the flask of
hot water the thermometer will fall&mdash;an effect opposite to
that produced in the previous experiment. This would
seem to show that cold is radiated, but as there is no
such thing really as cold, § 270, the effect must be attributed
to the radiation of heat from the thermometer to
the ice. If a hot ball be placed in the focus of one mirror
and a piece of phosphorus in that of the other, the
phosphorus will be set on fire, though the mirrors may
be twenty or more feet apart.</p>

<p>The reflection of heat may be exhibited very prettily
with the experiment represented in Fig. 218. A sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of bright gilt paper is rolled up in the shape of a funnel,
with the metallic side inward. Holding the larger end
toward a fire, the rays of heat coming from the fire into
the funnel are reflected toward a central line, and so pass
out of the smaller end of the funnel concentrated. If,
now, a bit of phosphorus or a lucifer match be held a
little distance from this end of the funnel it will be set
on fire.</p>

<p><a name="P_315" id="P_315"></a>
315. <b>Formation of Dew.</b>&mdash;It is by the radiation of heat
that dew is formed. The earth is constantly radiating
heat into space as well as the sun. In the daytime it
receives a great deal more than it radiates. But at night
this is reversed, and the earth is cooled. The cooled
earth condenses the moisture in the air which is in contact
with it, and so the moisture is deposited. If the
weather be very cold this is frozen, and then we have
frost instead of dew. You observe that the dew does
not <em>fall</em>, though this is the ordinary expression. Its
formation is analogous to the deposit of moisture which
we so often witness in a hot day in summer on the outside
of a tumbler containing cold water. As the cold
tumbler condenses the moisture in the air, so does the
earth at night, it being cooled by radiation, condense
the moisture which has accumulated in the air by evaporation
during the heat of the day.</p>

<p>There are some circumstances which have an influence
upon the deposition of dew and frost. Less is deposited
under a tree than outside of it, because all the heat which
radiates vertically upward from under the tree is radiated
back again by the tree. Hence the efficacy of a covering
over plants as a defense against frost. Clouds operate
in the same way, and for this reason no dew or frost
is deposited in a cloudy night. Neither is any deposited
in a very windy night, because the moving air promotes
evaporation, and thus prevents the accumulation
of moisture.</p>

<p>Dew is deposited in different amounts on different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
substances. This is owing to a difference in radiation.
Grass and leaves radiate heat better than earth, and
earth better than stone; and therefore while stones and
gravel-walks may be dry or nearly so, the loose earth
may be moist and the grass and leaves thoroughly wet.
So you see that not even the dew, plentiful as it is, is
wasted by the Creator, but is deposited just where it is
wanted to refresh the parched earth and its vegetation.</p>

<p><a name="P_316" id="P_316"></a>
316. <b>Gideon's Fleece.</b>&mdash;If you lay a fleece of wool upon
the ground, it is so poor a radiator of heat that no dew
will be deposited upon it, although there may be an
abundance of it on the grass and leaves in its neighborhood.
But this was reversed in the case of Gideon's
fleece. The laws of nature were set aside, and the fleece
was wet with dew while all around was dry.</p>

<p><a name="P_317" id="P_317"></a>
317. <b>Dew-Point.</b>&mdash;What is called the dew-point of the
air is that degree of temperature to which any substance
must be brought down in order to have dew deposited
upon it. This depends upon the amount of water there
is in the atmosphere. The more there is the higher is
the dew-point. When water condenses on a cold tumbler
in a hot day there is much more water in the air,
and the dew-point is higher, than when no moisture is
condensed upon the tumbler. So after a very hot clear
day the earth needs not to be much cooled to produce a
deposit of dew, because the air has become so highly
charged with moisture through the evaporation of the
earth under the hot sun. We can very readily at any
time ascertain the dew-point. Take a glass of water,
and, having a thermometer in it, drop into it some pieces
of ice, and watch the outside of the glass. As soon as
it begins to be dimmed with moisture look at the thermometer,
and you have the dew-point.</p>

<p><a name="P_318" id="P_318"></a>
318. <b>Freezing Mercury.</b>&mdash;Mercury can be frozen by
radiation when the cold is excessively severe, although
the thermometer may indicate a temperature considerably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>above -39°, the degree at which mercury freezes.
Suppose that in a clear, still night the temperature of
the air is at -20°. In order to freeze the mercury it
must be cooled down 19 degrees below this. Now this
can be done by surrounding the mercury with some good
non-conductor, as charcoal. This cuts off the supply of
heat to the mercury, while it is all the while giving off
heat into space by radiation. In like manner can ice be
formed in an atmosphere that is above the freezing point,
and this is often done in warm climates.</p>

319. <b>Latent Heat.</b>&mdash;You have seen, § 270, that our
sensations do not inform us accurately of the amount of
heat in any substance. The same is also true of the
thermometer. This only indicates the <em>sensible</em> or free
heat. There may be a great deal of heat locked up, as
we may say, in the substance, which can be brought out
or made free by some change in the substance. This
heat thus locked up is called <em>latent</em> heat.</p>

320. <b>Capacity for Heat.</b>&mdash;The more heat a substance
can take in and render latent the greater is its capacity
for heat, as it is expressed. Thus water has a much
greater capacity for heat than mercury. This can be
proved by various experiments. Thus, if we take two
vessels just alike, and having, the one a certain quantity
of water in it, and the other the same quantity of mercury,
and expose them to the same degree of heat, it will
take much longer to raise the water to any specified temperature
than the mercury. Why is this, when they are
both receiving the same amount of heat? It is because
the water renders a much larger portion of the heat latent
than the mercury does. We can reverse this experiment.
Take these same vessels with their contents raised to the
same temperature, as indicated by the thermometer, and
allow them to cool in the air side by side. The mercury
will cool much faster than the water, because it has much
less of latent heat to part with. The difference in capacity
for heat between water, oil, and mercury may be
shown by the experiment represented in Fig. 219. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
pound of water is put into one Florence flask, a pound
of oil into another, and a pound of mercury into a third.
They are all heated to 212°, and are then placed in funnels
filled with pounded ice, the funnels resting in glass
jars of the same size. Now in cooling these fluids down
to a certain point, say 32°, different amounts of the ice
will be melted, in the proportions of 100 and 50 and 3.
This shows the proportions of latent heat in them which
become sensible or free as their temperatures are lowered.</p>

321. <b>Relation of Latent Heat to Density.</b>&mdash;The
more dense a substance becomes the less is its
capacity for heat. The heat produced by hammering
iron is the latent heat rendered free by
condensation, this lessening the capacity of the
iron for heat. The same thing can be better illustrated
in the condensation of a very compressible
substance, as air. In Fig. 220 you have represented
a glass syringe with a closed end. If
there be placed in this end a little bit of cotton
wool moistened with ether, and the piston be
forced downward very quickly, the ether will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
set on fire. This is because the compression of the air
lessens so much its capacity for heat that a great deal
of its latent heat is made sensible or free. The heat
which is concealed in it in its ordinary state is, as we
may say, fairly squeezed out, as you would squeeze out
the water that is concealed in the interstices of a sponge.</p>

<p><a name="P_322" id="P_322"></a>
322. <b>Coldness of Air at Great Heights.</b>&mdash;You learned
in § 152 that the atmosphere is thinner the farther you
go from the earth. It is very thin, therefore, on the
summits of high mountains. This is the chief reason
why it is so cold there, for the rarer the air is the greater
is its capacity for heat, and the more of sensible or
free heat therefore can it render latent.</p>

<p><a name="P_323" id="P_323"></a>
323. <b>Relation of Latent Heat to the Forms of Substances.</b>&mdash;Whether
a substance shall be in the form of a
solid, liquid, or gas depends upon the amount of heat
which is latent in it. If you take a piece of ice and melt
it in a vessel, the ice and the water in the vessel that
comes from the melting of the ice are both at 32° until
the ice is all melted. But all this time heat is being communicated
to the ice and water. What becomes of it?
It is all taken up by the ice as it changes from its solid
to its fluid state, and becomes latent in it. In fact <em>every
particle of ice must have just so much of latent heat in
order to become fluid</em>. So, also, if water be heated to the
boiling point, 212°, and be kept boiling, the water will
remain at that point till it is all vaporized. All this time
the water is receiving heat, which, instead of raising its
temperature, is becoming latent in the particles as they
change from their liquid to their vaporous state. As I
said of the change from the solid to the liquid state, so
here, <em>every particle of the liquid must have just so much
of latent heat in order to become aeriform</em>. Whenever
therefore any solid substance becomes liquid, or liquid
becomes aeriform, heat is absorbed and becomes latent.
So, on the other hand, whenever any aeriform substance
becomes liquid, or liquid becomes solid, latent heat is giv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>en
out, and becomes free and sensible. The freezing of
water, then, is a source of warmth to the air in its neighborhood&mdash;a
fact which is practically made use of when
tubs or pails of water are placed in conservatories to keep
plants from freezing; and the thawing of snow and ice
is a source of cold, as is exemplified by the chilliness of
the air occasioned by this process.</p>

<p><a name="P_324" id="P_324"></a>
324. <b>Clouds and Latent Heat.</b>&mdash;The water of which
clouds are composed is heavier than air. Why, then,
does it remain suspended? Why is it necessary that it
should be collected into drops in order to have it fall?
This question can be answered by looking at the manner
in which clouds are formed. A cloud, I have stated in
§ 288, is made up of minute vesicles or bubbles containing
air. Now the air in these bubbles is lighter than
the air that is around the cloud, because it is warmer.
But how does it get its heat? In order to understand
this observe what the bubble is made from. It is made
from the water which was in the air in a state of vapor,
or in its aeriform state, for this is the state of water that
is evaporated and dissolved in the atmosphere. But
when it forms the vesicle it goes out of this state and
becomes a liquid, for the wall of the vesicle is a liquid
wall, just as the wall of a soap-bubble is. Now in passing
out of the aeriform into the liquid state some latent
heat must be made sensible. What becomes of this sensible
heat? It just heats the air in the vesicle, and so
makes it like a heated air-balloon. So all clouds are collections
of innumerable heated air-balloons, and the reason
that some clouds are higher up than others perhaps
is that their balloons have warmer and therefore lighter
air in them.</p>

<p><a name="P_325" id="P_325"></a>
325. <b>Freezing Mixtures.</b>&mdash;The intense cold produced
by these mixtures is the result of the change of free or
sensible heat into latent. For example, when salt and
snow are mingled together a melting of the two is quickly
produced. In this sudden change of a solid into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
fluid a great quantity of heat must be rendered latent,
and therefore there will be a great loss of sensible heat
by whatever the freezing mixture comes in contact with.
The process here, you see, is the opposite of solidification
in relation to latent heat. A portion of the snow,
after melting with the salt, becomes solid ice. Why is
this? It is because it gives up its sensible or free heat
to portions of the snow that are in the process of melting
and are therefore making heat latent.</p>

<p><a name="P_326" id="P_326"></a>
326. <b>Cold from Evaporation.</b>&mdash;If you pour a little ether
into the palm of your hand it will rapidly disappear in
vapor, producing a very cold sensation. This sensation
occurs because, in the change of the liquid into the vaporous
or aeriform state, some of the sensible heat of
your hand is abstracted to become latent in the vapor.
The evaporation of water also produces cold, though not
as decidedly as ether, because its change into vapor is
not so rapid at ordinary temperatures. We make a practical
use of the evaporation of water in many different
ways. Thus we sprinkle water in a hot day upon the
floors of piazzas, steps, etc., that the evaporation may
make much of the sensible heat about our houses latent.
For the same purpose, in hot climates, apartments are
often separated from each other by mere curtains, which
are occasionally sprinkled with water. So the inhabitants
of such climates often cool their beverages by keeping
a wet cloth for some time wrapped around the vessels
that contain them. Evaporation is an important
remedy for many cases of disease. For example, if the
head be hot, a steady application of a wet cloth to the
forehead, though a simple remedy, is generally effectual,
and sometimes is very important. Most people make
the application in a wrong manner. They put on several
thicknesses of cloth, when a single thickness is the best,
because it will best secure the evaporation, which is the
cause of the relief afforded.</p>

327. <b>Freezing in the Midst of Boiling.</b>&mdash;It is from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
quantity of heat rendered latent by evaporation that water
can be frozen in the midst of boiling ether; and, paradoxical
as it may seem, the boiling of the ether is the
cause of the freezing. The experiment is performed in
this way: Place a test-tube or a little thin vial with
water in it in the midst of some ether in a shallow vessel
under the receiver of an air-pump. On exhausting
the air the ether will boil, evaporation taking place rapidly
because the pressure of the air is taken off from the
ether. Now as the ether passes into vapor it extracts
so much free heat from the vial of water that the water
is cooled down to the freezing point, and so becomes
solid. Water can be frozen even by its own evaporation.
It is done in this way: Let a shallow vessel, <em>b</em>,
Fig. 221, contain a little water, and the vessel <em>c</em> oil of
vitriol or sulphuric acid. When the air is exhausted,
the pressure of air being taken off from the water, vapor
rises from it freely. As the sulphuric acid has a great
attraction for water it absorbs this vapor, and so vapor
continually rises from the water the more rapidly because
what is formed is absorbed, instead of remaining to
make pressure on the water. The result is that this rapid
formation of vapor, requiring that a great quantity of heat
should be made latent, at length abstracts so much heat
from the water that remains that this becomes solid.</p>

<p><a name="P_328" id="P_328"></a>
328. <b>Degree of Heat Endurable by Man.</b>&mdash;It was formerly
believed that the human body could not endure
with impunity, even for a short time, a much higher degree
of temperature than that which is met with in hot
climates. But in the year 1760 it was accidentally discovered
that a much higher temperature than this could
be endured. An insect was destroying at that time the
grain gathered in some parts of France, and it was found
that if the grain was subjected to a certain high degree
of temperature the insect was killed, and yet the grain
was not injured. In trying some experiments in regard
to this matter the experimenters wished to know the
point at which the thermometer stood in a large oven.
A girl attending on the oven offered to go in and mark
the thermometer. She did so, remaining two or three
minutes, and the thermometer was at 260°, that is, 48°
above the boiling point of water. As she experienced
no great inconvenience from the heat she remained ten
minutes longer, when the thermometer rose to 76° above
that point. These facts were published, and prompted
scientific men to try other experiments. In England,
Dr. Fordyce, Sir Charles Blagden, and others, went into
rooms heated even to 240° and 260°, and remained long
enough to cook eggs and steaks, and yet themselves suffered
little inconvenience. The pulse was quickened, the
perspiration was very profuse, but the heat of the body,
as ascertained by putting the thermometer under the
tongue the moment they came out, was scarcely raised
at all. The air in which they were roasted eggs quite
hard in twenty minutes, and when it was applied by a
pair of bellows to a steak it cooked it in thirteen minutes.
The question arises, how is it that this high degree of
heat did not produce more effect upon the body? One
reason is that the heat of the air in the immediate neighborhood
of the body was continually reduced by the
evaporation of the free perspiration, sensible heat being
thus converted into latent. Another reason is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
air is not a good conductor, and therefore did not communicate
its heat readily to the body. Dr. Fordyce and
his friends found that they could not touch with impunity
any good conductor, as the metals, and they were
obliged to wear upon their feet some non-conducting
substance.</p>

329. <b>Formation of Ice.</b>&mdash;Before dismissing the subject
of heat I must notice the grand exception which we have
to some of the operations of heat in the formation of ice.
Heat generally produces expansion. But in the case of
water this law of expansion is set aside, and the reverse
is established. This is done, however, only within a
small range of temperature, viz., from the freezing point
up the scale about seven degrees. In all degrees above
that the usual expansion by heat takes place. The exception
occurs at this part of the scale for a special purpose,
viz., <em>that water, in distinction from other substances,
shall become more bulky, and therefore lighter, as it takes
the solid form</em>.</p>

<p><a name="P_330" id="P_330"></a>
330. <b>Description of the Process of Freezing.</b>&mdash;In order
to make the process of freezing clear to you I will describe
it as it ordinarily occurs, that is, from the action
of cold air upon the surface of water. The uppermost
layer of the water imparts some of its heat to the air in
contact with it. This air rises and colder air takes its
place, which being warmed in its turn rises to make way
for more of the cold air. You have therefore a constant
current of warmed air upward from the water. In
the mean time there is a current of a different character
in the water&mdash;a downward one. As fast as the water at
the surface parts with heat to the air it falls, other warm
water taking its place, to cool in its turn and go down.
This falling of the cooled water goes on regularly until
a portion of water becomes cooled down to 39°, that is,
7° above the freezing point. This layer does not sink,
but remains at the surface, for it is lighter than the
warmer water below. This is because the law that heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
expands matter is now reversed. Beyond this point of
the thermometer the colder the water is the lighter it is.
As the cooling now goes on from the air coming, as before,
in successive layers to the water, the cooled water
at the surface continually increases. At first it is a mere
single layer of particles, but after a while it is quite a
body of cold water lying on the warmer water below.
At length some of it is cooled down to 32°, the freezing
point, and a thin film of ice now forms. The state of
things just at this stage of the process may be represented
by a simple diagram, Fig.
222. Let the line <em>a</em> represent
the film of ice. The space between
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> is the portion
of water cooled down below
39°. The space below <em>b</em> is occupied
by the water which is
above this temperature. In
the space between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> the
cooler the water is the nearer
it is to the surface. That is, from the line <em>b</em>, where the
water is exactly at 39°, as you go upward, the water
lessens in temperature, it being successively 38°, 37°, 36°,
etc., till, just in contact with the film of ice, <em>a</em>, it is at
32°. The ice goes on to thicken gradually by additions
below. But it is to be remembered that ice is a good
non-conductor, so that the very first layer of ice makes
the cooling of the water proceed more slowly than before.
And the thicker the ice becomes the slower is the
cooling. This secures against too great a formation of
ice.</p>

<p><a name="P_331" id="P_331"></a>
331. <b>Why the Above Exception to Expansion by Heat
Exists.</b>&mdash;That we may see the reasons in part for the
grand exception to the general law of expansion by heat
which I have illustrated, let us see what would be some
of the results if the exception did not exist. In that case
the process of freezing would be as follows: The water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
would communicate its heat from the surface to the air,
as before described, and there would be a constant downward
current of the cooled water. When any portion
of the water became cooled by the air down to 32°, it
would become ice, and would sink to the bottom. And
after the process of freezing had once begun, there would
be a continual accumulation of ice at the bottom so long
as the air remained cold enough to cool the water with
which it comes in contact down to 32°.</p>

<p>The result may be stated in the general thus: Freezing
would not begin so quickly as it now does; but when
once begun it would prove very destructive. It would
not begin as soon, because the whole of any body of water
must be cooled down to just this side of 32° before
it could begin. This would not take long where the water
is shallow, but it would where it is deep. All shallow
bodies of water, then, would be frozen up quite early in
the winter; and as water is a poor conductor, and thawing
must go from above downward, some of them would
not be thawed out again fully till quite into the next
summer, if even then. And where the water is quite
deep ice would at length begin to form, and when formed
it would be exceedingly slow in thawing. In some cases
it would never be thawed with such a body of non-conducting
water to guard it against the warmth above. It
is easy to see that the heat of spring and summer would
not thaw out any thing like the quantity of ice that it
now does. The reign of ice and snow on our earth
would therefore be vastly more extensive than now, and
what is worse, it would be extended more and more every
year. Under such circumstances there would be
great destruction of both animal and vegetable life. I
will mention, however, but a single item, as it would occupy
too much space to go into this subject with any
fullness. In the water under the ice, which is always
above 39°, except that which is close to the ice when
freezing is going on, there is a vast amount of busy life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
which would be destroyed if ice were formed at the
bottom, chilling all the water above.</p>

<p><a name="P_332" id="P_332"></a>
332. <b>Why the Freezing Point is at 32°.</b>&mdash;If the freezing
point of water were higher than 32°, freezing would
occur so early in the autumn, and the ice and snow
would last so late in the spring, that the season would
be too short to raise our supplies of fruits and grains.
If, on the other hand, it were at a lower point, the earth
would not have the protection of its light coat of snow,
but instead would be chilled by rains so cold that barrenness
would be the result. The multitudes of animals,
too, that now live so securely in the water, some of them
even with the ice above them, would all perish with the
cold.</p>

<p><a name="P_333" id="P_333"></a>
333. <b>Force of Expansion in Ice.</b>&mdash;As ice occupies one
seventh more room than the water from which it is
formed, it exerts in its formation an expansive force
which under various circumstances produces varied and
often remarkable results. Of the many experiments
which have been tried to show the force of this expansion
I will mention but one. A bomb-shell was filled
with water, at Montreal, and closed with an iron plug
which was driven in with great force. The plug was
thrown a distance of 400 feet by the expansion when the
water froze. This expansion is sometimes an inconvenience
to us, as in bursting water-pipes; but besides the
great service which it does in the earth, already noticed,
it is of service also in loosening the soil, and in supplying
it with requisite ingredients from the rocks by breaking
them up and pulverizing them in small quantities
from year to year.</p>

<span class="fs80">LIGHT.</span></h3>


<p><a name="P_334" id="P_334"></a>
334. <b>Nature of Light.</b>&mdash;We do not know what light is.
There are two suppositions in regard to it. One is that
of Sir Isaac Newton, called the theory of <em>emission</em>. According
to this light is a substance, but so ethereal that
it has no weight, and is capable of passing through various
substances of even great density. The other supposition
is what is called the <em>undulatory</em> theory. The advocates
of this, which is now quite generally received,
believe light to consist of undulations, waves, or vibrations
in an ether which is supposed to exist every where,
pervading all space and every substance. You perceive
an analogy here to sound, the vibrating medium in the
case of sound, however, being always some palpable substance&mdash;solid,
fluid, or aeriform. Heat is supposed, as
stated in § 271, to be a vibration of the ethereal substance,
as light is, though the two vibrations must of
course be somewhat different in character. Any body
that is capable of communicating the light-vibration to
this ether is said to be <em>luminous</em>.</p>

<p><a name="P_335" id="P_335"></a>
335. <b>Sources of Light.</b>&mdash;The chief source of light to
our earth is the sun, which is a permanently luminous
body. Then we have the light of combustion in its various
forms. Electricity is another source of light. Light
is sometimes emitted during decay or putrefaction of some
substances. Some animals&mdash;as fire-flies, glow-worms, and
phosphorescent animals in the sea&mdash;have the power of
emitting light.</p>

<p><a name="P_336" id="P_336"></a>
336. <b>Light Moves in Straight Lines.</b>&mdash;Light, like heat
and sound, radiates in straight lines in all directions from
its source. We can see this to be true by admitting rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of light into a darkened room through small openings in
the shutters, the rays making straight lines across the
darkness, as may be seen by the motes which are flying in
the air. The fact is recognized by the marksman in taking
aim, and by the engineer in making his levels. The
carpenter acts upon it when he tests the smoothness of any
surface by letting the light pass along over it to his eye.</p>

337. <b>Diffusion of Light.</b>&mdash;As light passes in all directions
from any body or point, the farther we go from its
source the less will the light be. If we take any two
rays of light, the farther we trace them from their source
the farther are they separated from each other, and what
is true of any two rays is true of all the rays. It follows
that the farther removed any surface is from a source of
light the less light will there be upon it. This decrease
of light in proportion to distance
is a perfectly regular
decrease, and it is as the
square of the distance; or,
in other words, the intensity
of light is inversely as the
square of the distance. Take
a screen, Fig. 223, and a candle,
placing a square piece of
pasteboard between them at
one foot from each. The shadow on the screen, you see,
covers a space four times as large as the pasteboard.
That is, the light that
shines on the pasteboard,
if allowed to
pass on to the screen,
would be diffused over
four times the space,
and therefore would
have only one-quarter
of the intensity. So if
as shown in Fig. 224,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the screen be placed at twice the distance from the pasteboard
that the light is, the shadow will cover a space
nine times as large as the pasteboard, and therefore the
light there would have one-ninth of the intensity which
it has where the
pasteboard is.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-260.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, it is seen
by Fig. 225 that
if the screen be
placed at the
distance of three
feet the intensity
of the light is
one-sixteenth of
that which it is at the pasteboard. While the distances,
therefore, are as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the intensity of the light
is <em>inversely</em> as the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, etc., that is <em>inversely
as the squares of the distance</em>.</p>

338. <b>Velocity of Light.</b>&mdash;The velocity of light is so
great that within any ordinary distances it may be considered
as instantaneous. Thus when we measure the
distance of a cannon by the difference between the time
of its flash and the report, we do not reckon the light to
consume any time in its passage to the eye. But when
we come to look at objects as distant as the sun and
other heavenly bodies, we reckon in our calculations the
time of the passage of light. It takes light eight minutes
to travel from the sun to us, a distance of ninety-five
millions of miles. With the telescope stars have been
seen which have been ascertained to be at such a distance
that it requires over ten years for their light to come to the
earth. Others have been seen which are much farther off,
but their distances have not been absolutely ascertained.
Some have been seen supposed to be at such a distance
that the light coming from them to the eye of the astronomer
was a hundred thousand years in its passage.</p>

339. <b>Roemer's Observations.</b>&mdash;The velocity of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
was first determined by Roemer, a Danish astronomer,
in 1676. It was done in his calculations and observations
of the eclipse of one of Jupiter's moons. After
making the calculation of the time it would take for the
satellite to pass through the shadow of the planet, he
observed its passage, and found that it did not come out
from the shadow as soon as his calculation required by
fifteen seconds. What was the difficulty? If the earth
had remained in one spot from the beginning to the end
of the passage of the satellite, the observation would
have come out exactly according to the calculation. But
the earth had moved during this time (about forty-two
hours and a half) the immense distance of 2,880,000
miles. The light of the emerging satellite therefore had
to travel over this additional distance to overtake the
earth, and it took fifteen seconds to do it. If we divide,
then, this distance by 15 we get the distance which
light travels in a second, which is 192,000 miles. All
this can be
made clear by
the diagram,
Fig. 226. Let
S be the sun,
J Jupiter, and
C one of its
moons emerging
from its
shadow. Let
A be the earth as it is when the eclipse of Jupiter's moon
begins. When it emerges the earth has passed to B,
and the light from the satellite has to travel as much
farther to reach it now as B C is longer than A C.
Roemer made other observations with the earth at some
other parts of her orbit with the same result.</p>

340. <b>Reflection of Light.</b>&mdash;Light, like sound and heat,
is reflected in straight lines when it strikes upon any resisting
substance. We can see this to be the case when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
it strikes upon any smooth and plane surface. And it is
true of light, as it is of heat, that the angles
of incidence and reflection are equal. Thus
if <em>c</em>, Fig. 227, be a reflecting surface, and
<em>b c</em> a line perpendicular to it, then a ray of
light, <em>d c</em>, will be reflected in the line <em>c a</em>,
and the angle of incidence, <em>d c b</em>, will be
equal to the angle of reflection, <em>b c a</em>.</p>

<p><a name="P_341" id="P_341"></a>
341. <b>How we See.</b>&mdash;We see the various objects around
us by the light which is reflected from them. Every
point of every surface that we see reflects rays or vibrations
of light to our eyes. Thus if we see a person there
are rays of light reflected into our eyes from every part
of him. These rays form an image of him in the back
part of each eye, and it is by this image that we see him,
as will be explained in full in another part of this chapter.
Reflected light is painting the images of objects in
the eye every moment in great abundance and variety.
If a speaker have an audience of a thousand persons all
looking at him, his image is at the same time in two
thousand eyes, and in each of these two thousand images
every motion and every changing expression are faithfully
depicted.</p>

342. <b>Mirrors.</b>&mdash;That reflected light does thus form
images of objects you see in the common mirror. The
image formed in it of any object comes from the light
reflected from that object into the glass. Then in seeing
the image light is reflected from it into the eye, there to
form a similar image, though of much less size. By using
two or more mirrors the reflections of the image can be
multiplied, and by some arrangements of them to a very
great extent. That the image appears to be at the same
distance beyond the surface that the object is before it,
is owing to the fact that the reflected rays come from
the glass at the same angle that the incident rays strike
upon it. This may be shown from Fig. 228 (p. 263).
Suppose <em>m m'</em> is a looking-glass, and an arrow, A B, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
before it. Rays of light come
from it at all points to the
glass. We will take only two
of these rays at each end of
the arrow. The ray A <em>g</em> will
be reflected to the eye at the
same angle in the ray <em>g o</em>, and
the ray A <em>f</em> will be reflected
in the ray <em>f</em> E. And the reflected
rays will have the same
rate of divergence as the incident
rays. The same can be
shown in regard to rays from
B or any other point on the
arrow. Now if the lines <em>o g</em> and E <em>f</em> be extended, they
will meet at the point <em>a</em>, which is at the same distance
behind the mirror as A is before it. The same thing can
be shown of the rays from B or any other point. Therefore
the image of the arrow will appear to the eye to
have the same relative position behind the glass that the
arrow itself has before it.</p>

343. <b>The Kaleidoscope.</b>&mdash;I have already noticed the
multiplication of the images of objects by using two or
more mirrors. In the kaleidoscope, by a particular arrangement
of mirrors, the images are multiplied, and by
changes in the position
of the objects the relative
positions of the images
are infinitely varied.
Fig. 229 will serve
to explain the operation
of the instrument. Let
A B and B C be two
plane mirrors placed at
right angles to each other,
and <em>a</em> an object before
them. Let I be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
position of the eye looking at the mirrors. The rays
<em>a f</em> and <em>a g</em> will be reflected to I as represented, and the
eye will see two images, which appear to be at <em>b</em> and E.
But the ray <em>a</em> K will be reflected to <em>c</em>, and then to I, so
that a third image will be seen at <em>d</em>. Here is but a single
second reflection, or reflection of an image; but by
placing the mirrors at an angle of 60°, 45°, and 30° the
images may be increased to six, eight, and ten, having a
circular arrangement. In the kaleidoscope two mirrors
are placed in a tube at an angle of 30°, and variously-colored
pieces of glass in the farther end of the instrument,
changing their relative position with every movement
of it, give an endless variety of images symmetrically
arranged.</p>

344. <b>Curved Mirrors.</b>&mdash;These may be concave or convex.
The action of a concave mirror upon light may be
illustrated by Fig. 230. If parallel
rays, as represented, strike
upon the mirror they will, in their
reflection, be made to <em>converge</em>,
or come together, at the focus, <em>a</em>.
But suppose the light comes from
this focus, the rays of course <em>diverging</em>,
or going away from each
other; then the rays, as reflected,
will be parallel. If the light or object be nearer to the
mirror than the focus, and the rays of course be more
diverging, then the effect of the mirror will be to lessen
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the divergency when'">the divergence when</ins> the rays are reflected. You see
that the tendency is to make the rays converge. And
hence concave reflectors are much used when it is desired
to throw a great amount of light in one direction.
The effect of the concave mirror upon the apparent size
and position of objects placed before it varies with the
relation of their position to the focus. The action of a
convex mirror upon light is the opposite of that of the
concave. Its tendency is to make the rays diverge. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
(Fig, 231), if parallel rays strike
upon a convex mirror they diverge,
as if they came from a focus
behind the mirror, as <em>b</em>, as indicated
by the dotted lines.</p>

345. <b>Refraction of Light.</b>&mdash;When
light passes from one medium
into another it is bent from
its course. This may be illustrated
by Fig. 232, in which
A B C D is a box, into which a
candle, E, is shining. The candle
is so placed that the shadow of the side A C falls at D.
But let the box be filled
with water, and now the
shadow is removed to <em>d</em>,
as if the candle were at
<em>e</em>. This is because the
rays of light from the
candle, in passing from
the air into the water, are bent or refracted so as to take
a different direction. Here we have light passing from
a rarer into a denser medium. Let us see now how it is
when light passes from a denser medium into a rarer.
This can be illustrated on Fig.
233. Let the vessel, A B C D,
be empty, and let a coin be
placed at O. Let the eye, E,
be in such a position that a
straight line, O G E, from the
coin to the eye would strike
the side of the vessel a little
below the edge, or, in other
words, that the edge of the vessel would prevent the
eye from seeing it. If now, keeping the eye in this position,
water be poured in up to a certain level, say F G,
the coin comes into view. This is because light coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
from the coin to L is bent into another direction, L E,
and the coin therefore appears to the eye to be at K.
In this case the refraction is <em>from</em> the perpendicular,
P Q, let down through the point L, where the light
emerges from the denser into the rarer medium. But
When light passes from a rarer into a denser medium the
refraction is reversed&mdash;it is <em>toward</em> the perpendicular.
It is from this refraction of light that a stick partly immersed
in water appears to the eye to be broken just at
the surface of the water.</p>

346. <b>Dawn and Twilight.</b>&mdash;The light of the sun, in
passing from space into our atmosphere, is refracted.
If it were not we should have no daylight preceding the
rise of the sun, or twilight after its setting; but light
would burst upon the darkness of night at once when
the sun appeared above the horizon, and darkness would
suddenly succeed to the light of day at sunset. As it is,
in the morning the light bends toward us as it strikes
across the atmosphere long before we see the sun, and
after the sun has disappeared from view at evening its
light bends toward us in the same manner. And farther,
we really see the sun in the morning before it gets above
the horizon, and in the evening after it has gone below
it. This may be made
clear by Fig. 234. Let
the central ball represent
the earth. Now as the
atmosphere is most dense
near the earth, and is
rarer as you go outward
from the earth, it is represented
in the figure as
having different layers in order that the operation of the
refraction may be more clear to you. The outermost
layer is exceedingly rare, and each layer is more dense
than the previous one as you go in toward the earth.
The light coming from the sun, S, below the horizon into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the first layer of air, instead of passing on straight to <em>a</em>,
as indicated by the dotted line, bends toward the earth.
Then in entering the second layer, instead of passing on
to <em>b</em>, it will be bent or refracted still more, as this layer
is denser; and so on through all the layers, being refracted
in each more than in the previous one. The result
is, that as every object is seen in the direction in
which the rays from it at length reach the eye, the sun,
though really below the horizon, appears to be above it,
as represented. The path of light from the sun, as it
passes through the air, is a curved line. This is because
the air, instead of being of uniform density, lessens in
density as we go from the earth. If it were of uniform
density the light would be refracted in straight lines, as
in the experiments in § 345.</p>

<p><a name="P_347" id="P_347"></a>
347. <b>Mirages.</b>&mdash;Sometimes inequalities occur in the
density of the lower portions of the atmosphere, causing,
of course, unequal refraction, and producing some strange
appearances, termed <em>mirages</em>. For example, at Ramsgate,
on the coast of England, there was seen, at one time, as
represented in Fig. 235 (p. 268), a ship at such a distance
that only her topsails were visible; and above in the air
there were two complete images of the ship, the uppermost
being erect and the under one inverted. Captain
Scoresby, in a voyage to Greenland, saw an inverted image
of a ship so well defined that he decided that it was
the image of his father's ship, the <i>Fame</i>, which was afterward
verified. The ship itself was at that time at a
distance of 30 miles. An incident in the early history
of the author's place of residence may be cited as an example
of mirage. A ship left for England freighted with
a valuable cargo, and having on board a large number
of the best citizens of the colony. Some time after there
was immense excitement in New Haven, because the inhabitants
saw, with great distinctness, what they supposed
to be this vessel, at only a little distance, apparently
sailing against the wind. But it soon disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
from view, part after part, until the whole was gone.
The ship itself was never heard from, and it was supposed
at the time that this appearance was a manifestation
of Providence for the purpose of informing the colonists
what had become of their friends. But what was
seen was undoubtedly the reflected image of this or some
other ship. It is such appearances as these that have
given rise to the stories which have been sometimes told
of phantom ships. Mirages are very common in the extensive
deserts in hot climates, exhibiting to the eye of
the traveler various deceptive appearances, as islands,
lakes, etc. In Bonaparte's campaign in Egypt such an
appearance caused whole battalions of thirsty soldiers to
rush forward, supposing at the moment that a plentiful
supply of water was at hand.</p>

<p>The most astonishing instance of mirage of which I
have ever heard is thus narrated: "The cliffs on the
French coast are 50 miles distant from Hastings, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
coast of Sussex, and they are actually hidden from the
eye by the convexity of the earth; that is to say, a
straight line drawn from Hastings to Calais or Boulogne
would pass through the sea. A year or two ago, however,
a Fellow of the Royal Society, who was residing
at Hastings, was surprised to see a crowd of people running
to the sea-side. Upon inquiry as to the cause of
this he was informed that the coast of France could be
seen by the naked eye. He immediately went down to
the shore to witness so singular a sight, and there discovered
distinctly the French cliffs extending for some
leagues along the horizon, and so vividly that they appeared
to be only a few miles off. The sailors and fishermen,
with whom Mr. Latham walked along the water's
edge, could hardly at first be persuaded of the reality of
the appearance; but as the cliffs gradually became more
elevated they were so convinced that they pointed out
to Mr. Latham the different places they were accustomed
to visit&mdash;such as the bay and the wind-mill at Boulogne,
St. Vallery, and other places on the coast of Picardy,
even as far as Dieppe, all the French shores appearing
to the English sailors as if they were sailing at a short
distance from them toward the harbors. With the aid
of a telescope the French fishing-boats were plainly seen
at anchor; and the different colors of the land upon the
heights, together with the buildings, were perfectly discernible.
The day when this occurred is said to have
been extremely hot, without a breath of wind stirring,
and the phenomenon continued visible in the highest
splendor until past eight o'clock in the evening, having
been seen for three hours continuously."</p>

348. <b>Visual Angle.</b>&mdash;In order that you may understand
the operation of lenses in relation to vision I must first
explain to you what is meant by the visual angle. In
Fig. 236 (p. 270) are represented arrows of the same size
at different distances from the eye. From the ends of
each of the arrows are drawn lines to the eye. The an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>gle
which these lines make in each case as they meet at
the eye is termed the visual angle. Now the apparent
size of an object depends upon the size of this angle.
The degrees of the angles are marked upon the figure.
Thus the visual angle of the nearest arrow is 120 degrees,
and that of the second is 60, only half as large.
The first arrow therefore appears twice as large as the
second. For the same reason it appears four times as
large as the third, eight times as large as the fourth, and
twelve times as large as the fifth. The same thing is
illustrated in another way
in Fig. 237. Here the arrows
<em>e f</em>, <em>g h</em>, and <em>i k</em> appear
to the eye as large
as A B, because they have
the same visual angle, and
for this reason make an
image of the same size in
the eye, as you see is indicated in the figure. It is hardly
necessary to say that what is true of objects as a whole
is true also of any part of them. Each part, however
small, has its visual angle, and
this governs its apparent size.</p>

349. <b>Lenses.</b>&mdash;Transparent
bodies having curved surfaces
are called lenses. There are six
kinds, represented in Fig. 238.
The lenses in most common use
are the double convex and double
concave. The explanation
of the mode in which these act
upon light will sufficiently illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>trate
the operation of the others. They act by refraction,
the convex collecting the rays, or bringing them
nearer together, and the concave putting them farther
apart. You can at once see, then, that a convex lens
by causing the rays coming from an object to converge
more, increases the visual angle, and therefore makes the
object to appear larger than it otherwise would. This
effect is illustrated by Fig. 239. The
rays of light coming from the arrow
are made by the lens so to converge
as to meet at <em>a</em>, instead of <em>b</em>, where
they would meet if they did not pass
through the lens. That is, by passing
through the lens they have a larger
visual angle, and therefore the object
is magnified. The distance between,
<em>c</em> and <em>d</em> shows the size which the arrow
would appear to have to the eye
placed at <em>a</em>.</p>

350. <b>Microscopes and Telescopes.</b>&mdash;What has been
said of the action of the convex lens upon the visual angle
will serve to explain the operation of the microscope.
This instrument may be single or compound. The compound
microscope has more than one lens, and is used to
magnify very minute objects. Its operation may be seen
by the diagram, Fig. 240.
Rays from the object, E F,
passing through the first
lens, or object-glass, as it
is called, form a magnified
inverted image, G H,
which is still more magnified
by the eye-glass, C D.
In the telescope we have also convex lenses, but they
are arranged differently from those of the microscope,
as the objects to be magnified are distant.</p>

pictures made upon slips of glass with coloring substances
which allow the light to pass readily are thrown
upon a screen magnified. It is a metallic lantern, A A,
Fig. 241, with a concave reflector, <em>p q</em>, and two convex
lenses, <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>. At <em>c d</em> is a space between the lenses
into which the pictures are introduced. L is a strong
light, which is in the focus both of the mirror and the
lens <em>m</em>. The picture is therefore illuminated strongly by
the rays reflected from the mirror and passed through
the lens. The lens <em>n</em> which is movable, is so adjusted
as to throw a highly magnified image of the picture upon
the screen. As the image is an inverted one the pictures
must be inserted upside down, that the images on the
screen may be upright. The <em>solar microscope</em> is, in its
essential parts, like the magic lantern, the sun being used
as the illuminator.</p>

352. <b>Camera Obscura.</b>&mdash;This instrument differs from
the magic lantern in giving us diminished images of objects.
An instrument of this kind can be arranged extemporaneously
any where. Thus, if into a darkened
chamber light be admitted through a small opening, inverted
images of any objects in front of the opening will
be formed upon a white screen in the opposite part of
the chamber. Such an arrangement is represented in
Fig. 242 (p. 273), C D being the chamber, L the opening,
and <em>a b</em> the image of the object A B. The images in
such a case, however, are faint, because the opening must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
necessarily be small, and therefore but few rays, comparatively,
come from the objects. By making the opening
larger, and gathering the rays that enter it with a double
convex lens, we can have well-defined and bright images
of objects. Though the camera obscura may have
various forms, I have described what is essentially the
arrangement of the instrument. One form of it, for
sketching either single objects or
groups of them in landscapes, is
represented in Fig. 243. Here
the rays of light coming from objects
strike upon a mirror, A B,
and are reflected through a convex
lens, C D, upon white paper
on the bottom, E F, of the box,
where the outlines of the images
are traced by the sketcher. The
light can enter only at the opening
above, for on the side of the
box which is open there hangs
down a curtain on the back of
the artist as he sketches.</p>

353. <b>The Eye.</b>&mdash;The eye is essentially a camera obscura.
It is a dark chamber in which images are formed
upon a screen in its back part, and the light which comes
from objects is admitted through an opening in front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
where there is a double convex lens. That you may understand
the manner in which the images are formed, I
give you, in Fig. 244, a map of the eye. At <em>a</em> is the
thick, strong white coat called the <em>sclerotic</em> coat, from a
Greek word meaning hard. This, which is commonly
the white of the eye, gives to the eyeball its firmness.
Into this is fastened in front, like a crystal in a
watch-case, <em>e</em>, the <em>cornea</em>. The sclerotic and cornea, you
see then, make together one coat of the eye, the outer
one. The cornea is the clear, transparent window of the
eye through which the light enters. Next to the sclerotic
coat comes the <em>choroid</em> coat, which is dark, to prevent
too much reflection back and forth in the eye. Then
you have a very thin membrane, <em>c</em>, the <em>retina</em>, the screen
on which the images are formed. This is composed chiefly
of the fine fibres of the nerve of sight, <em>d</em>. To return
to the front of the eye where the light enters&mdash;behind
the cornea is the iris, <em>g g</em>, which is immersed in a watery
fluid, <em>f</em>, called the <em>aqueous humor</em>. The light passing
through the cornea and the aqueous humor comes to the
crystalline lens, <em>h</em>, which, you see, is a double convex lens.
Passing through this and through a jelly-like substance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
called the vitreous humor, which fills all that large space
<em>i</em>, it strikes upon the retina, <em>c</em>, where it forms the images
of the objects from which it came.</p>

<p>You see now how the eye is like a camera obscura.
You have in it the dark chamber with its screen, the
opening through the iris, the pupil, for the admission of
the light, and just behind this opening the lens for gathering
or concentrating the light before it falls upon the
retina. The refraction of the light is not, however, done
wholly by this lens. The projecting cornea, with its
contained aqueous humor, refracts it considerably, for it
forms a convex lens.</p>

354. <b>Distinct Vision.</b>&mdash;In order that vision may be
perfectly distinct, it is necessary that the rays coming
from each point of the object which is seen should, on
converging, meet together, or be brought to a focus on
the screen of the eye,
the retina. Thus, in Fig.
245, the rays which
come from <em>a</em>, the end
of the arrow, meet on
the retina at <em>b</em>, and
those from <em>c</em>, the other end, are brought to a focus at <em>d</em>.
Now the muscles of the eye have considerable power in
adjusting the eye to objects at different distances, so as
to bring the rays in most cases together exactly at the
retina. They fail to do it with objects that are very
near. You can see that this is so if you bring any object,
as your finger, nearer and nearer to the eye. You
will at length find that you can not see it distinctly.
The reason is, that the rays from
it diverge so much that the cornea
and lens can not make them converge
enough to meet at the retina.
This divergence of rays at
different distances is illustrated
in Fig. 246. Suppose that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
are looking at some very minute object. The nearer you
bring it to the eye the better you can see it, till you come
to a certain point. There the rays are so divergent, as
you can readily see by the figure, that the lenses of the
eye can not make them converge sufficiently for distinct
vision. Now just here the microscope comes in to help
the eye by causing these divergent rays to come nearer
together before they enter the window of the eye, the
cornea.</p>

355. <b>Near-Sighted and Far-Sighted.</b>&mdash;Some persons
have their eyes so shaped that they can not fully adjust
them to objects at different distances. Thus the near-sighted
can see with distinctness only objects that are
near. The reason is that the rays converge too much,
and are brought to a focus before they arrive at the retina,
as represented in
Fig. 247. The images
therefore of distant objects
are indistinct. If
the retina could in any
way be brought forward
a little the difficulty
would be obviated. But as this can not be done,
concave glasses are resorted to, which counteract the
effect of the too highly refractive power of the eye. In
the far-sighted the difficulty is of an opposite character.
The refractive power is so feeble that when near objects
are viewed the rays are not brought to a focus soon
enough, as seen in
Fig. 248. Convex
glasses are used in
this case, making the
divergent rays of
near objects less divergent
before they enter the cornea.</p>

<p><a name="P_356" id="P_356"></a>
356. <b>Images in the Eye Inverted.</b>&mdash;The images formed
on the retina are inverted. This can be proved by taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the eye of an ox and carefully paring off the back of it,
leaving little else than the retina itself. Holding now a
candle before the eye, its image may be seen inverted
upon its rear part. The question arises why it is that
we see objects erect when their images on the retina are
inverted. On this point I will quote from my <cite>Human
Physiology</cite>: "It has been supposed by some that we
really see every thing reversed, and that our experience
with the sense of touch, in connection with that of vision,
sets us right in this particular. And this it is supposed
is the more readily done from the fact that our own
limbs and bodies are reversed as pictured on the retina,
as well as objects that are around us, so that every thing
is <em>relatively</em> right in position. But if this be the true
explanation, those who have their sight restored after
having been blind from birth should at first see every
thing wrong side up, and should be conscious of rectifying
the error by looking at their own limbs and bodies.
But this is not so. The above explanation of erect vision,
and other explanations of a similar character, are
based upon a wrong idea of the office which the nerve
performs in the process of vision. It is not the image
formed upon the retina which is transmitted to the
brain, but an impression produced by that image. The
mind does not look in upon the eye and see the image,
but it receives an impression from it through the nerve;
and this impression is so managed that the mind gets
the right idea of the relative position of objects. Of the
way in which this is done we know as little as we know
of the nature of the impression itself."</p>

<p><a name="P_357" id="P_357"></a>
357. <b>Single Vision.</b>&mdash;Whenever we see any object with
both eyes there is an image formed in each eye, and impressions
go from both eyes by the optic nerves to the
brain. And yet with these two impressions there is no
double vision so long as the two eyes correspond with
each other in situation. This is because the image in
one eye occupies the same place on the retina that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
image in the other eye does. The correspondence is ordinarily
perfect, the two eyes turning always together in
the same way, upward, downward, or laterally, without
the least variation. You can observe the effect of a
want of this correspondence by pressing one of the eyes
in some direction with the finger while the other is left
free to move in obedience to the muscles. When this is
done every object appears double, because its image occupies
in one eye a different part of the retina from what
it does in the other, and so two different impressions are
carried to the brain. The same thing occurs in squinting,
in which the action of the muscles of the two eyes
does not agree. Ordinarily in squinting there is not
double vision, because the mind has the habit of disregarding
the impressions that come from the defective
eye. But when squinting occurs suddenly from disease
there is double vision, for it takes a little time to form
the habit referred to.</p>

<p><a name="P_358" id="P_358"></a>
358. <b>Stereoscope.</b>&mdash;The images of objects in the two
eyes, though always similar, are not generally perfectly
alike. They are so only when the object presents a simple
surface, as in the case of pictures. When the
object presents two or more surfaces to the sight the
images are more or less unlike. This can be illustrated
in a very simple way. Hold a book up straight before
your eyes with its back toward you. You see the back
and both sides. Now if you shut your right eye you
will see with the left the back of the book and the left
side. That is, these two parts of the book are imaged
on the retina of the left eye. By shutting the left eye it
will appear that the image in the right is different, for
you see now with the back the right side of the book.
Here you have the explanation of the stereoscope. In
the right side of this instrument you have the picture of
the object as the object itself would appear to the right
eye, and in the left side you have the picture of it as it
would appear to the left eye. Thus, if a book in the po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>sition
alluded to above were the object, in the right picture
there should be represented the back together with
the right side of the cover, and in the left the back with
the left side of the cover. The two impressions, carried
to the brain by the optic nerves, give together the impression
of a solid book. The same principles apply to
the representation of all solids in the stereoscope.</p>

359. <b>Thaumatrope.</b>&mdash;Each impression made upon the
optic nerve by light lasts about the eighth part of a second.
No distinct impressions can be made, therefore,
upon the retina unless they succeed each other with less
rapidity than this. If, for example, in the revolution of
a wheel, eight or more spokes pass by one point in a
second, they can not be seen as distinct spokes, but will
be mingled together, producing one continuous impression.
So, too, if a light revolve so as to describe a circle
in an eighth part of a second it will appear to the eye as
one unbroken circle of light. It is this continuous impression
on the retina that makes small objects, as the
cars pass swiftly along, appear to run in long lines along
with us. The fact thus developed is made use of in the
contrivance of a toy called the thaumatrope. A picture
is made on each side of a circular card, and whirling the
card around very rapidly by means of two strings fastened
to it, the two
pictures are made
to mingle together
as one. Thus
in Fig. 249 are
represented the
two sides of such
a card, on the one side there being the picture of a dog,
and on the other that of a monkey. When made to revolve
rapidly the monkey will be seen sitting on the back
of the dog.</p>

360. <b>Light Compound.</b>&mdash;I have thus far spoken of light
as if it were a simple thing. But it is compound. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
ray of white light has in it seven different colors. That
this is so we can prove by taking a beam of light by itself
and dissecting it, as we may say, or separating it
into its seven parts. I will show you how this can be
done. Let D E, Fig. 250, a beam of the sun's light,
pass through a small opening in a shutter into a dark
room. The rays will pursue a straight course, and if a
screen be placed at F they will make a spot of white
light. But if a glass prism, A B C, be held in the position
represented the rays will be refracted, and when received
upon the screen M N the light will be separated
into seven colors in the order which is given. The figure
thus produced is called the solar spectrum. Observe
why it is that the colors are separated. It is because
they are refracted unequally. If they were equally refracted
the light upon the screen would be white, as before
it was refracted. The violet rays are most refracted,
the indigo next, the blue next, etc., and the red are
the least refracted of all.</p>

<p><a name="P_361" id="P_361"></a>
361. <b>Proportion of the Colors in Light.</b>&mdash;The colors in
light are not equal in amount. If we divide the spectrum
into 360 equal parts the proportion in the colors
will be as follows: red, 45; orange, 27; yellow, 40; green,
60; blue, 60; indigo, 48; violet, 80.</p>

<p>Some suppose that there are really but three simple
colors, red, yellow, and blue, the other colors being produced
by a combination of these. Thus red and yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
will together form orange, and yellow and blue will form
green.</p>

<p><a name="P_362" id="P_362"></a>
362. <b>Recomposition of Light.</b>&mdash;After decomposing
light by passing it through a prism we can bring the
separated colors together again and form from them
white light. The manner in which this is done is represented
in Fig. 251.
The beam of light,
after passing through
the prism S A A', instead
of proceeding
in the direction indicated
by the dotted
lines to form the spectrum,
is made to pass through the prism S' B B', placed
in a reversed position, and its rays are refracted so as to
assume their original relation, making a white beam, M.
Here the second prism counteracts the effect of the first,
because its position is exactly the reverse.</p>

<p>Newton very justly considered the decomposition and
the recomposition of light as affording the most positive
proof that white light contains all the seven colors. He
tried various experiments to prove the same thing. Thus
he mingled together intimately seven powders having
the seven prismatic colors, and found that the mixture
had a grayish-white aspect. He also painted a circular
board with these colors, and
found that on whirling it so
rapidly that the colors could
not be distinguished the whole
board appeared to be white.
In order to have this succeed
perfectly the proportion between
the colors must be observed,
as in Fig. 252. A very
pretty way of illustrating the
composition of light is to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a top painted in this way. When the top is whirling rapidly
it is white, but as it slackens its motion the seven
colors appear.</p>

<p><a name="P_363" id="P_363"></a>
363. <b>Colors of Objects.</b>&mdash;The color of any object depends
upon the manner in which it reflects light. Thus,
if it be red, it reflects the red rays of the spectrum, absorbing
the other rays; and if it be green, it reflects the
green rays, etc. If it reflect all the colors together, it is
white; and if it reflect none, or almost none, of the light,
it is black.</p>

<p>You can readily see why the color of an object varies
with the kind of light that shines upon it. If an object
which is red in sunlight be exposed to a yellow light, as
a yellow flame, or sunlight that has passed through a
yellow-colored glass or curtain, it loses its red color, for
there are no red rays in the light to be reflected by it
into our eyes. A person exposed to such a light has a
deathlike paleness, the lips and skin losing entirely their
red color. This effect can be witnessed at any time by
mixing alcohol with a little salt on a plate and setting
fire to it. You see in what has been said the reason that,
in examining goods in the evening, especially by candle-light,
we find the colors often differ somewhat from those
which they have in the day.</p>

<p>In some substances the colors are changeable with varying
positions, though the light be the same. We see
this often in shells and minerals. We see it also in some
fabrics, as changeable silk. This is owing to the arrangement
of the particles, it being such as to occasion variety
in reflection with changes of position.</p>

<p><a name="P_364" id="P_364"></a>
364. <b>Colors of the Clouds.</b>&mdash;There is no more gorgeous
display of colors than we sometimes see in the clouds at
morning or evening, especially the latter. These colors
are occasioned simply by refractions and reflections in
the minute vesicles (§ 288) of which the clouds are composed.
How simple are the materials, light, water, and
air, and yet how grand and diversified are the results!</p>

365. <b>The Rainbow.</b>&mdash;In producing the colors of the
rainbow the materials are less even than in producing
those of the clouds. They are only light and water. The
colors come from the reflection and refraction of light in
the drops of the falling rain. I will illustrate the manner
in which these reflections
and refractions take
place. Take a single drop,
represented in Fig. 253.
Let S be a beam from the
sun. This entering the
drop at A, is refracted,
and passes to B, at the
farther side of the drop.
Here a portion of it is lost by its proceeding on in the
line B C. The remainder is reflected to D, and passes to
E, being refracted as it thus passes out into a rarer medium,
the air. Here you have a single reflection and
two refractions. But in the second bow, which is sometimes
formed, there are
two reflections as well as
two refractions, as represented
in Fig. 254. The
beam of light, S, from the
sun enters the drop at A,
is refracted, and passes to
B. Here a portion proceeds
on in the direction
B C. The other portion is reflected to D. Then this is
lessened by a part of it proceeding on in the line D E.
What remains is reflected to E. You see here the reason
that the second bow is not so bright as the primary
one. In the latter there is but one reflection in each
drop, and therefore there is but one point where there is
loss of light by its passing on out of the drop; while in
the former there are two reflections, and therefore loss
at two points.</p>

366. <b>Circumstances under which Rainbows are Seen.</b>&mdash;A
rainbow is seen when the spectator stands between
the sun and falling rain. This commonly can not be the
case, except in the latter part of the day. It sometimes,
though very rarely, happens that a shower passes from
the east to the west in the morning, and then a rainbow
can be seen in the west. Fig. 255 is intended to show
under what circumstances a rainbow is seen. Let a
horizontal line be drawn from O, the observer, to P, a
point directly under the middle point of the arch. If
this line were extended backward from the observer it
would be precisely in the direction of the sun from him.
That is, the sun is directly opposite the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
bow. Now if the drop at A reflect a red ray to the eye
of the spectator all other drops similarly situated in the
arch will reflect red rays. So if B reflect a green ray
all other drops similarly situated will do the same. And
so of C, reflecting the violet ray. For the sake of clearness
there are only three reflections represented, but the
same is true of all the seven colors. In the secondary
bow the arrangement of the colors is reversed, the red
being at the inner part of the bow and the violet at the
outer part. The double reflections are manifest in the
drops D, E, and F. What I have described as taking
place in a few drops takes place in countless multitudes
of them in forming the bow. As the exact place of the
rainbow depends not only upon the direction of the rays
of the sun but also the position of the spectator, it is
clear that no two spectators see precisely the same bow,
for the drops that form it for the one are not the same
drops that form it for the other. This is very obvious
if the two be quite distant from each other; but it is
equally true if they are very near together, although in
this case the bow for the one would be very nearly coincident
with the bow for the other. It is also true that the
rainbow of one moment is not the rainbow of the next,
for as the drops that reflect it are falling drops there must
be a constant succession of them in any part of the bow.</p>

<p><a name="P_367" id="P_367"></a>
367. <b>Colors in Dew-Drops and Ice-Crystals.</b>&mdash;We often
see something very analogous to the rainbow in the
dew. As the sun rises, if, with our backs to it, we look
at the dew-drops, we see all the colors of the rainbow
glistening every where before us, as if the grass were
filled with gems of every hue. Here we have the same
refraction and reflection in drops of water, and the resemblance
fails only in the regularity of arrangement
which the rainbow presents. We see the same thing
also if the ground is strewed with bits of ice which have
fallen from the branches of the trees, and the sun shines
aslant upon them.</p>

368. <b>Heat and Light.</b>&mdash;We have not yet finished our
dissection of the beam of light, begun in § 360. In the
beam of light which is separated into the seven colors
there is heat also; and in the separation it is found, as
represented in Fig. 256, that the rays of heat are most
abundant just beyond the red rays, while they are very
sparing indeed at the other end of the spectrum. The
greatest degree of light is at the boundary between the
orange and the yellow rays.</p>

369. <b>Chemistry of Light and the Daguerreotype.</b>&mdash;There
is a chemical power also in light, producing every
where, quietly but thoroughly, important effects. The
chemical rays are most abundant at the end of the spectrum
opposite to that where the heat-rays abound. It
is these which do the work in Daguerreotyping. In this
art light has been said to be the painter; but this is not
strictly true. Light makes the image of the object, just
as it does in the camera obscura and in the eye, but it
has no power to fasten that image upon the metallic plate.
This is done by the chemical rays, which, like the rays
of heat, go along with the light. Without going into
particulars, which will be given in Part Second, the process
of Daguerreotyping is simply this: A metallic plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
is so prepared that the chemical rays of light shall act
upon it sensibly. Then the object to be taken&mdash;a person
or any thing else&mdash;being before the instrument, a slip of
ground glass is inserted, and when the operator gets the
lens so adjusted that a good image of the object is seen
on the glass he takes this out and puts in its place the
metallic plate. Rays of light coming from the object
make the image, and the chemical rays bound up with
the light act upon the plate so as to fix the image there.</p>

370. <b>Origin of the Term.</b>&mdash;The ancients observed that
when certain substances were rubbed together singular
phenomena were produced. One of these substances was
amber, and as the Greek name for this is <span title="êlektron">ηλεκτρον</span>, the
power which is thus excited into action has been called
electricity.</p>

371. <b>Attraction and Repulsion in Electricity.</b>&mdash;One of
the most common effects of electricity is attraction. If
we rub a tube or rod of glass with woolen or silk it will
attract light articles, such as cotton, feathers, lint, etc.,
so that they will adhere to it. But repulsion
is also an effect of electricity under certain
circumstances. In order that the explanation
of these two opposite effects may
be clear to you, I will detail some of the experiments
which exhibit both. Suppose that
we have a pith ball, A, Fig. 257, suspended
by a silk thread, B, from a stand, C. I must
premise that silk does not readily let electricity
pass over it, or is a non-conductor,
and therefore any electricity communicated
to the pith ball will remain there unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
something be brought in contact with it or very near it.
If now you rub a glass tube, thus exciting electricity upon
it, and then bring it near the ball, it will attract the ball
to it, and then in a moment repel it, so that it will
stand off from the tube and retreat from it if you follow
the ball with the tube. Why is this? It is supposed
that there is a subtile fluid on the electrified glass, some
of which passes to the ball as it touches the glass, so that
the ball and the glass are in a similar condition. But
the particles of the fluid repel each other; and this is the
reason that the ball is repelled from the glass as soon as
it becomes charged with a part of the electricity of the
glass. For the same reason if two pith balls hanging
from a standard become electrified from a glass tube or
rod they will repel each other, for they are in the same
electrical condition.</p>

<p><a name="P_372" id="P_372"></a>
372. <b>Vitreous and Resinous Electricity.</b>&mdash;Suppose now
that you rub a rod of sealing-wax with woolen or silk
and hold it near a pith ball which has been electrified
from glass. It will attract the ball. The reason is that
an electricity is excited on the sealing-wax of a different
kind from that which is excited on the glass. The former
is called <em>resinous</em>, and the latter <em>vitreous</em> electricity.
They are supposed to be two fluids, which have a strong
attraction for each other, while, on the other hand, the
particles of either fluid are repellent to each other. It is
this attraction between the two fluids which causes in
the case just stated the sealing-wax to attract the ball to
itself. We can illustrate this attraction in another way.
Take two pith balls and electrify them, the one from
glass and the other from sealing-wax. Brought near together
they will attract each other, because they have
two unlike electricities. This, you see, is just the reverse
of the effect produced in an experiment cited at
the conclusion of § 371, in which the electricities were
alike in the two pith balls. Again, if you bring the
rubbed sealing-wax near to the ball electrified from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
glass, the ball will be attracted, and the same effect will
follow if you bring the rubbed glass near to the ball electrified
from sealing-wax.</p>

<p><a name="P_373" id="P_373"></a>
373. <b>Franklin's Theory.</b>&mdash;In § 372 is developed the
theory now commonly received in regard to electricity.
The theory of Franklin was different. He supposed that
there is but one electric fluid, and that all bodies are in
their usual state charged with a certain portion of it,
some having more than others, according to their capacity
for electricity. While a body is in its usual state
there is no manifestation of electricity. The fluid is in a
quiescent condition, because its particles are prevented
from repelling each other by the attraction which exists
between them and the particles of the substance. But
this quiescence can be disturbed by friction and other
causes. Thus if a glass rod be rubbed with a piece of
silk, the natural equilibrium is disturbed, the glass having
an excess and the cloth a deficiency of electricity. The
glass is therefore said to be <em>positively</em> and the cloth <em>negatively</em>
electrified. The equilibrium can be restored in
the case of a positively electrified body by having its excess
drawn off, and in the case of a negatively electrified
body by having its deficiency made up by receiving electricity
from other bodies. Though this theory is discarded,
the terms positive and negative derived from it
are retained, being applied to the two fluids<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or electricities,
and they are often designated by the two signs +
and -.</p>

<p><a name="P_374" id="P_374"></a>
374. <b>Upon What the Kind of Electricity Excited Depends.</b>&mdash;It
depends on what a substance is rubbed with
whether vitreous or resinous electricity is excited in it.
Thus smooth glass rubbed with woolen cloth or silk will
be positively electrified; while if it be rubbed upon the
back of a cat it will exhibit negative or resinous electricity.
So, also, if a resin, as gumlac or sealing-wax,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>be rubbed with silk or woolen cloth, it will be charged
with resinous electricity, but it will be charged with vitreous
or positive if it be rubbed with sulphur. The terms
vitreous and resinous are therefore incorrect, for they
are based upon the idea that one kind of electricity is
always excited on glass, whatever the friction may be
made with, and that the other kind is always excited on
resins. The most decided illustration of the incorrectness
of these terms we have in the fact, that while smooth
glass rubbed with silk or woolen cloth becomes charged
with positive (vitreous) electricity, roughened glass
rubbed with the same gives us negative (resinous) electricity.
Below I give a table of substances, any one of
which has positive electricity developed on it when it is
rubbed with any substance below it on the list, and negative
when rubbed with any substance above it:</p>

375. <b>Conductors and Non-Conductors.</b>&mdash;Electricity
passes over the surface of some substances very readily;
while over others it moves with very great difficulty,
and therefore very slowly and sparingly. The former
are termed conductors, and the latter non-conductors.
As in the case of heat, so with electricity there are no
substances which are wholly non-conducting. The best
of all the conductors are the metals, those least liable to
oxydation being the most perfect. Next come charcoal,
water, living substances, flame, smoke, steam. The best
non-conductors are gumlac and gutta-percha. Then come
amber, resins, sulphur, glass, silk, wool, hair, feathers,
cotton, paper. Non-conductors are sometimes called <em>insulators</em>,
from the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insula</i>, as they serve to
confine electricity within certain bounds, and prevent its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
escaping. Thus in the experiments with pith balls, already
cited, the silk threads by which they are suspended
prevent the electricity from escaping from them. So
the glass knobs on which the wires of the telegraph rest
are insulators, preventing the electric fluid from escaping
down the poles into the ground.</p>

376. <b>Electricity Always on the Surface.</b>&mdash;There is a
marked difference between heat and electricity in the
manner in which they are disposed of. Heat pervades
all the particles of substances, and in its conduction
spreads through them, while electricity in its ordinary
movements operates altogether on the surface. A hollow
ball, therefore, can contain as much electricity as a
solid, and a hollow conductor of electricity is just as effectual
as a solid one. The following experiment exhibits
in a very striking manner this disposition of electricity
to occupy the surface alone: Let
<em>a</em>, Fig. 258, be a metallic ball supported
by a glass stand, <em>b</em>; and let
<em>c c</em> be metallic caps which will just
cover the ball, having non-conducting
handles, either glass or gumlac.
Now, after having charged the ball
with electricity, let the caps held by the insulating handles
be carefully placed over the ball. On withdrawing
them it will be found that the electricity of the ball has
all passed to the outer surface of these caps.</p>

<p><a name="P_377" id="P_377"></a>
377. <b>Electrics and Non-Electrics.</b>&mdash;It will be observed,
on looking over the list of conductors and non-conductors,
that among the non-conductors are those substances
in which electricity is easily excited by friction, such as
glass, amber, silk, etc. These were therefore called electrics.
The conductors, on the other hand, were called
non-electrics, it being supposed that electricity could
not be excited with them. But this has been found
not to be true. For example, if a metal be insulated by
being placed on a pillar of glass or of gumlac, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the electricity, when excited, can not pass off readily, its
generation can be made manifest. It is probably true
that every substance is more or less an electric, it being
difficult to make this manifest in the case of conductors,
because the electricity passes off as fast as it is generated.</p>

<p><a name="P_378" id="P_378"></a>
378. <b>Electricity Every Where Active.</b>&mdash;I have said that
there is electricity in all substances, each having its own
capacity for it, but that in the usual condition of substances
the electricity is in a state of equilibrium, and
therefore of quiet. We see this quiet disturbed whenever
there is a thunder-storm, when we rub glass or silk,
or a cat's back, or when we work an electrical machine.
But the active state of electricity is not limited to such
palpable demonstrations as these. Electricity is undoubtedly
in action every where and always, although we can
seldom appreciate and measure its action. Wherever
there is motion there is a disturbance of the equilibrium
of electricity, and a consequent return to this equilibrium.
And this change from the one state to the other
must be the constant cause of important changes and
operations in the world around us, and in our own bodies.
Let us look at some of the indications of this universality
electrical action. The friction of any electric
upon another awakens it. The friction of the belts
upon the drums in cotton factories does it quite freely.
Every stroke of India rubber upon paper as you erase a
pencil mark excites electricity. The blowing of air upon
glass does the same. So, also, does the blowing off of
steam from an engine. Electricity has been excited even
upon ice by rubbing it when cooled down to 13° below
zero. Experiments upon the air have shown that there
is usually some free electricity in it, the atmosphere being
generally in a positive state, especially when the air
is dry and clear. It is constantly generated from one
source and another. It is generated every where by
evaporation. Every gust of wind, causing friction of
the particles of the air upon various substances, gener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>ates
it. Motion of every kind probably generates it.
Chemical action, as you will see in another part of this
chapter, generates it every where. It is generated also
in the operations of life, and in some animals there are
special organs&mdash;electrical batteries&mdash;for the generation
of this agent.</p>

<p><a name="P_379" id="P_379"></a>
379. <b>Induction.</b>&mdash;A remarkable influence is exerted by
an electrified body upon another body in its usual state
when brought near it, and this influence is called induction.
I will illustrate this by Fig. 259. Let A be a metallic
ball standing on a
glass pillar, and charged
with positive electricity.
Let B be a metallic cylinder
supported upon two
glass pillars. Now if A
be placed near B, but not
near enough for the electric
spark to pass from it
to B, it will destroy the equilibrium of the two electricties
in B, the negative electricity being accumulated at
the end near A, and the positive at the remote end.
This is because the positive electricity in A repels its
like in B and attracts the unlike fluid. You observe that
there is a pair of pith balls suspended at each end of B,
and also at the middle. The two balls at the positive
end repel each other because they are charged with the
same electricity, and so with the balls at the negative
end. But the balls hanging from the middle are not affected,
because they are on middle ground between the
two electricities. Here is no communication of electricity
from A to B, but only an influence upon the quiescent
balanced electricities of B. Accordingly, if the surplus
electricity of A be discharged by putting the hand
or any good conductor upon it the influence will cease,
the equilibrium in B will be restored, and the pith balls
will all hang straight down. The same effect will be pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>duced
if A be withdrawn to a distance from B, and the
influence will be renewed if A be brought near again.</p>

<p>If instead of one conductor we use two, B and C, Fig.

we shall have the negative

if we withdraw C from B
we may have the two electricities
separate, B being
charged with the negative
and C with the positive.</p>

380. <b>Electrical Machine.</b>&mdash;You are now prepared to
see how the common electrical machine operates. There
are two kinds&mdash;the plate and the cylindrical. The plate
machine, Fig. 261, has at <em>p</em> a large plate of glass, and at
<em>r</em> a rubber which consists of two brass plates lined with
leather which is stuffed, the pressure of which upon the
glass is regulated by a screw. Above this rubber is a
brass ball, <em>d</em>, and a brass chain connects the rubber and
the ball with the floor, or, in other words, with the earth.
At <em>c</em> is what is called the prime conductor&mdash;a hollow
brass cylinder with rounded ends, having attached to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a rod with points, as seen at <em>a</em>. There is a similar rod
attached to it on the other side of the glass plate. The
different parts of the instrument are supported on glass
pillars, <em>g g g</em>, standing on a wooden platform. The lower
part of the plate is covered with a case of silk, which,
being a non-conductor, prevents the electricity on the
glass from being lost in the air, and also serves to keep
the plate free from dust. The rubber is covered with an
amalgam of tin, zinc, and mercury, this being found very
effectual in exciting electricity. The operation of the
machine is this: As the plate revolves positive electricity
is collected upon the glass, and negative electricity upon
the rubber. The former, as it comes to the points at <em>a</em>,
goes to them and passes on by the rods to the prime conductor,
while the latter passes from the rubber by the
chain to the earth. The points at <em>a</em> are of great service
in collecting the electricity, because the fluid is always
much more ready to go to points than to conductors of
a blunt shape.</p>

of silk, and on the rear
part of the cylinder is the
rubber. At <em>d</em> is the prime
conductor.</p>

<p><a name="P_381" id="P_381"></a>
381. <b>Experiments.</b>&mdash;Many experiments may be tried
with the electrical machine. I will cite a few of them:</p>

<p>If pith balls be attached to the prime conductor, as
seen in Fig. 261, they will stand out from each other as
soon as the machine is worked, because they are both
charged with the same kind of electric fluid.</p>

<p>Let a small figure with its head covered with hair be
placed upon the prime conductor. As soon as the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>ductor
becomes charged with electricity the hair stands
out, as represented in Fig. 263, for the same reason that
the pith balls diverged in the previous experiment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>So, also, if you place on the conductor a figure having
attached to it strips of tissue-paper, they will diverge
in the manner shown in Fig, 264.</p>

<div class="figright">

</div>

<p>Let a metallic plate, <em>a</em>, Fig. 265, be suspended
by a chain to the prime conductor, and another
plate, <em>b</em>, be supported upon a conducting stand.
If figures of paper or pith be placed between
these plates as the machine is worked they will
move about briskly between the plates, being
alternately attracted and repelled by the communication
of the electricity.</p>

<p>The experiment represented in Fig. 266 is a very beautiful
one. Let <em>a b</em> be a brass rod with
an arch, <em>g</em>, by which it can be suspended
from the end of the prime
conductor. To this rod are suspended
three bells, the two outer ones by
chains, and the middle one by a silk
thread; also two clappers, <em>d</em> and <em>e</em>, by
silk threads. The middle bell has a chain, <em>f</em>, connecting
it with the table&mdash;that is, with the earth. The operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of the apparatus is this: As soon as the outer bells become
electrified they attract the clappers. These, on
touching the bells, receive a portion of their electricity,
and are repelled. They therefore strike against the middle
bell, to which they impart the electricity which they
received from the outer bells. They swing back again
then in the same state that they were in at first, and now
are attracted again by the outer bells. This goes on so
long as the electricity is communicated.</p>

with a sharp knife little portions of the foil. If now with
your finger on one end of the line of foil at <em>a</em>, you present
the ball G to the prime conductor, the electric fluid
will run along the whole length of the line from G to <em>a</em>.
In doing this the letters are beautifully illuminated, a
spark being produced at each interruption of the line.
So rapid is the passage of the electricity that the whole
appears to the eye simultaneously illuminated.</p>

boring holes in the four corners of
a piece of board sufficiently large to

amusing experiments can be tried
with this. A person standing upon it can be highly
charged with electricity by holding a chain connected

in Fig. 263, and he can give electric shocks to
other persons from any part of his body.</p>

in giving an account of the electrical machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
spoken of the readiness with which electricity is received
by points. It is discharged from them with equal readiness;
so that, if a metallic point be attached to the prime
conductor, the electricity will be carried off into the air
nearly as fast as it is received upon the conductor. And
as it passes off it creates a current in the air as it strikes
upon it. The reaction of the air upon the electrical currents
can be very prettily exhibited
with the apparatus represented
in Fig. 269, which consists
of a cap, A, resting upon the point
of a rod, and having pointed wires
branching out from it in a wheel-like
arrangement. You observe
that the points are all bent one
way. If this apparatus be set upright
upon the prime conductor, the wheel can
be made to revolve rapidly by working
the machine. As the reaction of the air
against the gases issuing from the rocket
makes it rise, so the same reaction against
the electricity issuing from these points
causes the circular motion. If electricity
be discharged from a point in a darkened
room it appears like a brush of light, as
represented in Fig. 270.</p>

384. <b>Leyden Jar.</b>&mdash;The Leyden jar, Fig.
271, is so called because it was contrived at
Leyden. It was suggested by an accidental
result of an experiment tried there with
the electrical machine. It consists of a glass
jar coated upon the inside and the outside
to near the top with tin-foil, and having a
metallic rod passing through the cork, with
one end touching the inner coating, and the
other surmounted by a brass ball or knob. The jar is
charged by holding the knob near to the prime conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>or
while the machine is worked. The electricity passes
by the metallic rod to the inside coating of the jar, and
accumulates there. This is positive electricity. In the
mean time there is an accumulation of negative electricity
on the outside coating. But how is this? It is by
the repulsion of positive electricity for itself, and its attraction
for its opposite, negative electricity. As you
hold the jar in your hand positive electricity is repulsed
from its outside through your arm earthward, while negative
electricity is attracted to it by the positive which
is within. The two fluids get as near to each other as
possible. They are prevented from coming actually together
by the non-conducting quality of the glass. If a
slip of tin-foil were made to connect the inside foil with
the outer, there would be no accumulation of electricity
on the inside, for as fast as it passed from the prime conductor
to the inside it would pass out over the bridge
of foil to the outside, and down your arm and body to
the earth.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-299.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 272.</div>
</div>

<p>If there were no communication of the outside with
the earth the jar would not be charged. No electricity
would pass to it, because the positive electricity which
is on the outside can not be driven off, and no negative
electricity can be received. To
make this plain, suppose that the
jar, <em>a</em>, Fig. 272, having a bent rod,
is suspended to the prime conductor,
<em>b</em>. Here you have the inside
tin-foil connected with the source
of positive electricity. But the outside
is insulated. No electricity can
pass from it or to it. It has both positive and negative
electricity, but they are in equilibrium. If there were a
preponderance of negative electricity there, it would attract
positive electricity to it as near as possible, and so
the latter would enter the jar from the conductor. But
there is no such preponderance, and so, though a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
may enter&mdash;a spark or two&mdash;there will not be enough to
charge the jar sensibly, because there is no attraction in
that direction. But bring now another jar, <em>c</em>, near to
the outside coating of <em>a</em>, and there is a movement at once
in the electricities. The positive electricity has a chance
now to pass off from the outside of <em>a</em> to the inside of <em>c</em>,
leaving therefore a preponderance of negative electricity
on the outside of <em>a</em>, which exerts an attractive influence
on the positive electricity of the conductor drawing it to
the inside of the jar.</p>

<p><a name="P_385" id="P_385"></a>
385. <b>Discharge of the Leyden Jar.</b>&mdash;The jar may be
discharged by making a communication between
the inside and outside by means of any
conductor. It may be done with the discharging-rod
(Fig. 273). This has two slender
metallic rods, with brass knobs at their
ends, and jointed at <em>a</em>, so that the knobs can
be separated to different distances. The handle
is glass, so that as the electricity passes
through the rods none of it may be communicated
to the hand. In discharging the jar one
knob is placed upon the outside foil, and the
other is brought near to the knob of the jar.
The two fluids now rush together from their attraction,
and in doing so a bright flash is produced, going from
the knob of the jar to that of the discharging-rod, and
with this a report. You can yourself be the conductor
to discharge the jar. If, having one hand upon the outside
of the jar, you bring the other near its knob, the
fluids meet in you as they do in the discharging-rod, and
a shock will be experienced in proportion to the amount
of charge in the jar. Any number of persons can together
receive the same shock. To do this they must
join hands, and the person at one end of the row must
touch the knob of the jar while the person at the other
end has his hand upon the outside.</p>

<p>You may touch either the knob of the jar or the out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>side
coating <em>separately</em>, and the power that is in it remains
quiet; but the moment that you touch both it
bursts forth, because a bridge is made upon which the
two fluids can meet.</p>

<p>In a dry air the charge in the jar can be retained for
some time, the communication between the two electric
fluids being very slow through the medium of air. It is
otherwise when there is much moisture in the air, for
water is a good conductor. For this reason, if you let
the moisture from your breath come upon the jar between
the outside coating and the rod, the jar will be
discharged soon, though imperceptibly, the moisture
making a medium of communication between the inner
and outer electricities.</p>

386. <b>The Electrical Sportsman.</b>&mdash;In this contrivance,
Fig. 274, the discharge
of the Leyden
jar is very prettily
exhibited. The
jar, <em>c</em>, has a rod with
two branches. On
the end of one of
these, B, are suspended
pith balls
cut in the shape of
birds. On the other
is a knob by which the jar can receive its charge from
the prime conductor. After it is charged it is placed on
the stand with its knob, <em>b</em>, near the gun, <em>a</em>, of a metallic
figure. The suspended birds, you observe, stand out
from each other, because they are charged with the same
fluid, positive electricity, and therefore are repellent.
Now when the chain, <em>e</em>, which is connected with the outside
of the jar, is made to touch the foot of the metallic
image, the connection between the inside and outside of
the jar is established. Of course there is an instantaneous
flash between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, and the birds, losing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
electricity, fall, and hang as they did before the jar was
charged.</p>

387. <b>Electrical Battery.</b>&mdash;By combining together a
number of jars, having the insides
all connected together, as
seen in Fig. 275, with metallic
rods, and the outsides connected
together in a similar manner, we
have what is termed an electrical
battery. By such an arrangement
we can accumulate a large
amount of electricity, which can be discharged in the
same way essentially as in the case of the single jar.</p>

<p><a name="P_388" id="P_388"></a>
388. <b>Light of Electricity.</b>&mdash;The light produced by electricity
is not occasioned by any thing like combustion.
It depends obviously upon the resistance which is offered
to its passage. Thus when the electric fluid passes
through air from the prime conductor to the knob of
the Leyden jar it causes a flash of light, but when it arrives
at the knob the flash ceases. What is the reason
of the difference? In both cases it has the resistance of
the air, for when it comes to the knob it passes over the
<em>surface</em> of the knob and rod; but in the latter case it is
so diffused in its conduction over the metallic surface
that it meets with much less resistance from the air. By
experiments with the air-pump it is found that the denser
the air is the more vivid is the spark; and if electricity
be passed through a glass vessel from which the air has
been mostly exhausted we have the streams of light seen
in the aurora borealis, which are so strikingly in contrast
with the vivid flashes of the lightning. In the experiment,
§ 381, in which the word light is made by
the passing electricity, we have a striking illustration
of the production of the spark by the resistance of the
air. If the foil were one continuous surface the electricity
would be diffused over it without giving any
light. It is only where the electric fluid has to leap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
through the air from one portion of foil to another that
the light is seen.</p>

<p><a name="P_389" id="P_389"></a>
389. <b>Sound of Electricity.</b>&mdash;The report of electricity is
a sort of crack or snap from the sudden condensation of
the air by the rapid passage of the fluid. The rolling of
thunder is occasioned by the reverberation of the first
sound among the clouds. The nearer the flash is to us
the more like a crack is its first sound as it comes to our
ears.</p>

<p><a name="P_390" id="P_390"></a>
390. <b>Mechanical Injuries from Electricity.</b>&mdash;When any
great amount of electricity meets in its passage with any
imperfect conductor it does much violence to it. Thus
it rends wood, scatters water, breaks glass, etc. Various
experiments have been tried illustrating the manner in
which mechanical injuries result from electricity. Thus
if it be made to pass through a card or several leaves
closely pressed together, there is a burr on each side of
such a character as to show that two forces moving in
opposite directions have made their passage.</p>

<p><a name="P_391" id="P_391"></a>
391. <b>Heat Produced by Electricity.</b>&mdash;Electricity always
produces in its passage some amount of heat, probably
by its mechanical effect. When it is diffused over a
large conducting surface the heat is not sufficient to be
observable; but if it be confined to the surface of a small
wire the heat may be sufficient to melt or even burn it.
Various effects can be produced by the heat thus caused
by the passage of electricity. Gunpowder may be exploded
by it. Alcohol and ether may be readily ignited
by it, especially the latter. Gas can sometimes be lighted
by pointing the finger to an opened burner after walking
across the room two or three times briskly, rubbing
the feet upon a thick carpet.</p>

392. <b>Franklin's Discovery.</b>&mdash;It had very early been
conjectured that the electricity produced by the electrical
machine is identical with lightning; but it was reserved
for our countryman Franklin to prove the fact.
A tall spire which was being erected in Philadelphia in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
1752 he conceived might be used in his investigations,
but before it was completed the sight of a boy's kite in
the air suggested to him another plan. He made a kite
by stretching a silk handkerchief over a frame, and sent
it up as he saw a thunder-shower rising, his only companion
being his son. Having raised the kite, he attached
to the end of the hempen string a key, and also a silk
ribbon, by which he insulated his apparatus, as seen in
Fig. 276. He now watched with much anxiety the result.
A cloud arose, which he supposed, from its appearance,
was well charged with electricity, and yet no effect was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
seen. Franklin began to despair; but he soon saw some
loose fibres of the hempen string bristling up, and, applying
his knuckle to the key, received just such a spark
as he had often received from the conductor of an electrical
machine. The discovery was made, and Franklin
was at once overcome with emotion at the thought of
the immortality which it would give his name. He felt
very much as Archimedes did when, after making one
of his grand discoveries as he lay in a bath, he went
home saying all the way, <span title="Eurêka! Eurêka">Εὕρηκα! Εὕρηκα!</span> The fame
of the discovery, made in a manner so simple and yet so
original, spread every where, and prompted to many experiments
by other philosophers. One, Professor Richman
of St. Petersburg, fell a victim to his investigations.
While he was attending a meeting of the Academy of
Sciences he heard the sound of distant thunder, and hastened
home to make some observations with an apparatus
which he had erected. While doing this a charge
of electricity flashed from the conducting rod, and piercing
his head killed him instantly. His assistant, who
stood near, was struck down, and remained senseless for
some time, and the door of the room was torn from its
hinges.</p>

<p><a name="P_393" id="P_393"></a>
393. <b>Lightning-Rods.</b>&mdash;It was the discovery of Franklin
which led to the custom of attaching lightning-rods
to buildings. The object of a lightning-rod is to conduct
any electricity in a cloud that may come over the
building down into the ground. For this purpose the
rod should terminate in the air in points, as these, as you
saw in § 380, so readily receive the electric fluid. The
rod should be separated from the house by wooden supports,
and it should pass so far into the ground as to
have its end in the midst of continual moisture. The
points should be gilt, in order to preserve from corrosion,
or they may be made of silver or platina. Lightning
is very apt to go down in chimneys, as smoke is a
very good conductor; and therefore it is well to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the rods go up by chimneys, especially if they are to
have fire in them during the summer. Lightning-rods
often undoubtedly are of service when there is no obvious
passage of the lightning down them, by quietly and
continuously receiving electricity upon their points, and
passing it down into the earth.</p>

394. <b>Galvanic or Voltaic Electricity.</b>&mdash;This form or
mode of electricity I will barely notice here, reserving
its full consideration for Part Second, where it appropriately
belongs. The history of its discovery is interesting.
The first dawning of Galvanism is to be found in
an experiment noticed by Sulzer, a citizen of Berlin, in
1767. He states that if a piece of zinc be placed under
the tongue, and a piece of silver upon it, on being brought
in contact a metallic taste is perceived, and a shock is
felt by the tongue. Sulzer attributed the effect to some
vibratory motion occasioned by the contact of the metals,
and, satisfied with this fanciful explanation, pursued
the inquiry no farther. The statement excited but little
notice until other facts of a similar character were
brought out in 1790 by Galvani, professor of Anatomy
at Bologna. He observed that the legs of some frogs,
which had been obtained for his invalid wife, were convulsed,
when near an excited electrical machine, on touching
the nerves with a knife. In contrast with the example
of Sulzer, he was led to examine the matter further.
He found that the effect was produced when no electricity
was communicated from the machine, by establishing a
connection between the nerves
and the muscles by some conductors.
For example, when
a strip of zinc was placed in
contact with the nerve which
goes to the lower extremities,
and a strip of copper in contact
with the legs, on bringing
the two together at the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
end the legs would be convulsed, being drawn up, as
represented in Fig. 277 (p. 306). But Galvani did not
get at the true explanation. He supposed this to be an
exhibition of animal electricity, regarding the muscles as
being a sort of Leyden jar, the nerve being the medium
of communication with the inside.</p>

<p><a name="P_395" id="P_395"></a>
395. <b>Volta's Pile.</b>&mdash;The observations of Galvani awakened
much interest in all scientific minds, and of course
there was much of inquiry, observation, and experiment.
Professor Volta, of Pavia, went a step farther than Galvani
toward the true explanation, in referring the effects
to the contact of dissimilar metals, and he was led by
this view of the subject to construct his <em>pile</em> or battery&mdash;called
after him the voltaic pile&mdash;the object of which was
to produce a much greater amount of electricity than
could be obtained by the contact of only two pieces of
metal. The pile is made of circular pieces of copper,
zinc, and cloth, the cloth being moistened
with salt-water. They are arranged
as represented in Fig. 278.
First a disk of copper is laid down,
then upon this one of zinc, then one
of cloth, and so on in the same order,
the top of the pile ending in a plate
of zinc. If you touch one end of the
pile with a moistened finger and the
other end with a finger of the other
hand, you will feel a shock like that from a Leyden jar.
The communication between the two ends of the pile
may be made by wires, as seen in the figure. Volta afterward
changed this to the form of a cup battery, the
plates of metal being immersed in a series of cups in a
mixture of sulphuric acid and water. There have been
various improvements from time to time, but the arrangement
is in all the different batteries essentially the same.
Although Volta accomplished so much he did not arrive
at the truth in full. His "contact theory," as it is called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
so long received as the true theory, gradually gave way
to the true explanation, viz., that the electricity produced
is owing to chemical action.</p>

<p><a name="P_396" id="P_396"></a>
396. <b>Difference Between Frictional and Voltaic Electricity.</b>&mdash;The
electricity produced by the friction of the
electrical machine is more intense than that of the voltaic
battery. Voltaic electricity, on the other hand, is
much more abundant, and is more continuous and lasting.
As it is therefore more steady and more easily controlled
than frictional electricity, it is used in the working
of the Telegraph.</p>

397. <b>Loadstones.</b>&mdash;It was discovered many centuries
ago that a certain ore of iron has the property of attracting
pieces of common iron or of steel. The fact was
probably considered at first as a mere curiosity, and the
world were slow to find out its value. It is not till quite
recently that it has been discovered that in magnetism
we have one of the great forces of the earth; and even
now we know but little probably of the real extent and
variety of its action. New and important discoveries
are yet undoubtedly to be made in regard to the agency
and the laws of this mysterious power, and its connections
with the other grand forces of nature. The terms
magnet and magnetism come from the fact that the loadstone
was first found near Magnesia, an ancient city in
Asia Minor. This ore appears in considerable masses in
the iron mines of Sweden and Norway, and also in different
parts of Arabia, China, and Siam. It has occasionally
been found in small quantities in England and
in this country.</p>

<p><a name="P_398" id="P_398"></a>
398. <b>Attraction of Magnetism.</b>&mdash;The attraction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
magnet and iron for each other is exhibited in many different
ways. If a magnet be brought near to a heap of
iron-filings or needles, it will have a quantity of them adhering
to it as you raise it up. In the toy fishes of children
there is fastened in the head a bit of iron, which
occasions the following of the fishes after the magnet.
In this case you can see very plainly that the nearer the
magnet and the iron are to each other the stronger is
the attraction. Indeed, the attractive influence is governed
by the same law in regard to distance as the common
attraction of matter is, viz., it is inversely as the
square of the distance. The attraction also is mutual
here, the iron attracting the magnet as much as the magnet
does the iron.</p>

399. <b>Poles of the Magnet.</b>&mdash;Every magnet has two
poles. It is about these poles where the chief power resides.
For this reason, if a magnet be rolled in iron-filings,
these are collected about the ends, as represented
in Fig. 279. There
is a diminution of
attraction from the
ends to the middle
line, which is called the <em>neutral line</em>. These poles are
called north and south poles, because if a magnet be suspended,
or be supported
upon a pivot, so that it can
revolve, it will take a north
and south direction, one of
its ends invariably pointing
toward the north. In Fig.
280 is represented a magnet
supported upon a pivot, C.</p>

<p><a name="P_400" id="P_400"></a>
400. <b>Magnetism by Induction.</b>&mdash;The magnet in exerting
its attraction really temporarily makes a magnet of
what it attracts. Actual contact is not necessary to this
result. Thus if a large key be only brought very near
to a powerful magnet it will support small keys, as rep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>resented
in Fig. 281. When the key is removed
away from the magnet the keys attached to it fall.
You see the analogy to the induction of electricity
noticed in § 379. As in the induction of electricity,
so here the two ends of the body in which
the influence is induced are in opposite states.
If the end of the magnet, to which the first key
is near or attached, be the north pole, the end of
the key next to the magnet is the south pole, and its farther
end is the north pole. The same is the case with
the small key attached to the end of the large one. And
so if a nail should hang from the small key, and a needle
from that, both of these would have the same polarities.
But all this would be reversed if the large key were attached
to the south pole of the magnet. In this case the
upper end of each of these articles would be the north
pole, and its lower end the south pole.</p>

<p><a name="P_401" id="P_401"></a>
401. <b>Attraction and Repulsion in Magnets.</b>&mdash;You have
seen in induction that in magnets <em>like poles repel while
unlike attract</em>. But this law can be more strikingly illustrated.
If a magnet be placed on a pivot, as in Fig.
280, and another magnet be brought near it, attraction
or repulsion will be manifested according to the mode
of presentation. If a north pole be presented to a north
pole, or a south to a south, repulsion will be the result.
But if a north pole be presented to a south, or a south
to a north, then attraction will be manifested.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="P_402" id="P_402"></a>
402. <b>Magnetic Curves.</b>&mdash;The polarity of magnetism
causes a very singular arrangement of iron filings when
gently agitated upon a sheet of paper over a magnet,
as represented in
Figure 282. The
curves which you
see have been supposed
by some to
be occasioned by
the escape of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
fluid or influence from the magnet in these particular directions.
But they are owing entirely to the fact that
each bit of filing is polarized by the bit next preceding
it in the row reckoning from the magnet outward, the
nearest one in each row deriving its magnetic state from
the magnet itself. This being so, as the chief power resides
in the ends of the magnet, it is easy to see how
such a disposition of the lines of magnetic filings is effected.
These curves may be beautifully and curiously
varied by having several magnets variously arranged under
the paper.</p>

<p><a name="P_403" id="P_403"></a>
403. <b>Artificial Magnets.</b>&mdash;The power residing in the
loadstone can be communicated readily, as you have seen,
to iron and steel. Though soft iron takes the magnetic
influence more readily than steel, it does not retain it as
steel does, and the latter is therefore used in making artificial
magnets. When a magnet imparts its magnetic
influence it loses none of its own power, whether it be
an original loadstone or an artificial magnet. There, are
many ways of imparting magnetism permanently to steel,
but I will notice only two of them. If you wish to magnetize
a bar or needle pass one pole of a magnet from
one end of it to the other a considerable number of times,
always in the same direction. A more effectual way is
to take two magnets, and, placing the south pole of one
and the north pole of the other in contact over the middle
of the bar or needle, draw them slowly and steadily
apart toward the opposite ends. This process must be
repeated several times.</p>

404. <b>Horseshoe Magnets.</b>&mdash;One of the most
common forms of the magnet is the horseshoe
magnet, Fig. 283. There is a piece of soft iron
attached to the end of this, held there by attraction.
This is called the <em>armature</em>. So long as
it is suffered to remain there it is a magnet having
its <em>two</em> poles, the north pole + being attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>to the south pole - of the magnet which holds it,
while the reverse is the case with its
south pole. The object of the armature
is to preserve the power of the
instrument. Indeed it is found that
the exertion of the magnet's power
not only preserves but actually increases
it. If you attach, therefore,
to a magnet an armature having a
hook, as seen in Fig. 284, you can add
to the weight gradually from day to
day, and so considerably augment the
power of the magnet.</p>

<p><a name="P_405" id="P_405"></a>
405. <b>Magnetic Needle.</b>&mdash;The magnetic
needle is a very small magnet
fixed upon a pivot. As it points north and south it is
of great use to the mariner. The mariner's compass is
a round box with such a needle balanced in it, and having
a card on which is drawn a circle divided into thirty-two
parts, as seen in Fig. 285. The original compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
was a rude affair, consisting of a slip of loadstone laid
upon a piece of cork floating in water. The date and
place of its first use are unknown.</p>

<p><a name="P_406" id="P_406"></a>
406. <b>Declination of the Needle.</b>&mdash;The declination of
the needle is its deviation from a north and south line.
It is in comparatively few parts of the earth's surface
that there is no deviation from this line to the east or
the west. "True as needle to the pole" has become a
proverb, and when it was first uttered it was supposed
to be founded in strict truth; but modern investigation
has shown not only that the needle varies in its pointing
in different localities, but that it varies to some little degree
in its variations. The declination of the needle was
first observed by Columbus in his first voyage of discovery,
and it occasioned great alarm among the sailors,
who, as Irving states, "thought the laws of nature were
changing, and that the compass was about to lose its
mysterious power." Notwithstanding these and other
observations of a similar character, no great account was
made of the declination of the needle till the middle of
the seventeenth century. But since that time extensive
records of its declinations at different localities have been
made, and tables and charts have been constructed exhibiting
them. These declinations are not constant, but
vary somewhat every day, from the influence, it is supposed,
of the sun upon the earth.</p>

407. <b>Dip of the Needle.</b>&mdash;It is found that in most parts
of the earth, if a needle be balanced before it is magnetized,
and then be suspended from the same point, it will
not be balanced, but one end will dip downward. This
fact was discovered by Norman, a London optician, in
1576. He found that the dip at London was toward the
north at an angle of 72°. In pursuing the investigation
of this phenomenon it was found that going from the
north toward the equator the dip constantly lessened,
until a point was reached where the needle was horizontal.
Then, on going south of this, a reverse dip oc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>curred,
that of the south pole, and the farther south the
needle was carried the greater was the dip. In the
north, Captain Ross in 1832 came to a locality north
of Hudson's Bay, in lat. 70° 5' N., long. 96° 45' W., where
the magnetic needle, freely suspended, was in a vertical
line. No such locality has yet been discovered toward
the south pole.</p>

<p><a name="P_408" id="P_408"></a>
408. <b>The Earth a Magnet.</b>&mdash;You can readily see, from
all that has been stated in regard to the magnetic needle,
that the earth is a magnet, or has that covered up
in it which in some way acts as such. The dip of the
needle shows that the two poles of this magnet are somewhere
near the north and south poles of the earth. The
locality which Captain Ross found must be near the
north pole of the magnet in that quarter of the world.
The vertical position of the needle there is analogous to
the straight lines of iron filings which you see in Fig.
282, near the poles of the magnet; and it is easy also to
trace the analogy between the dip of the needle at different
distances from what is called the magnetic equator
of the earth, where the needle is horizontal, and the
curves which you see extending from pole to pole. The
different declinations of the needle and the different intensities
of the magnetic force in different localities corresponding
in latitude show that the magnet in the earth,
if there be one, is irregular in shape, or in some way has
its power varied much in differed parts of the earth's
crust.</p>

409. <b>The Earth as a Magnetizer.</b>&mdash;As the earth is really
a magnet, it might be expected to impart magnetism
by induction as other magnets do. And this is found
to be the fact. If you hold a bar of soft iron in the direction
of the dip of the needle it becomes a magnet, its
lower end being the north pole, and its upper the south.
That this is so can be ascertained by bringing a small
magnetic needle near each end. No effect of this kind
is produced when the bar is held horizontally east and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
west. Lightning-rods, pokers, upright iron bars in fences,
etc., are often found to be magnetized because they have
continued so long nearly in the required position for
magnetization. When a bar of iron has been magnetized
in the manner indicated, its magnetism may sometimes
be fixed by giving it a stroke with a hammer. It
is a curious but inexplicable fact that this vibration of
the particles of the iron should have this effect. But
though such vibration helps to impart magnetism, it is
not at all favorable to its retention, for magnets are always
injured by blows or falls, or indeed any rude treatment.
For this reason care is requisite in removing an
armature from a magnet. If pulled off abruptly the power
of the magnet is lessened.</p>

<p><a name="P_410" id="P_410"></a>
410. <b>Magnetism in Other Substances besides Iron.</b>&mdash;It
was formerly supposed that magnetism was confined
to ferruginous substances, but this has been found not to
be true. Various minerals are magnetic, especially when
they have been heated, also some of the precious stones,
and even silica, which enters so largely into some of the
rocks of the earth. And it is supposed by some that future
investigations will show that the influence of magnetism
is as extensive in the earth as that of electricity.</p>

<p><a name="P_411" id="P_411"></a>
411. <b>In what Magnetism is Like Electricity.</b>&mdash;Magnetism
is like electricity in several particulars: 1. Its
power is on the surface of bodies. 2. It is of two kinds,
north and south, or boreal and austral, comparing with
the positive and negative electricities. 3. The same rule
of attraction and repulsion applies to both; viz., like repel
and unlike attract. 4. As electricity can be communicated
by induction, so can magnetism.</p>

<p><a name="P_412" id="P_412"></a>
412. <b>In what Magnetism is Unlike Electricity.</b>&mdash;The
circumstances in which magnetism is unlike electricity
are chiefly these: 1. The obvious manifestations of magnetism
are to a great extent confined to one class of substances,
the ferruginous, and to but a portion of them;
while electricity makes its manifestations in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
with all kinds of substances. 2. Magnetism is never
transferred as electricity is from one body to another,
but a body gains rather than loses in imparting magnetic
power to other bodies. 3. The two magnetisms,
the boreal and austral, can not be obtained separately as
the two electricities can. If a magnet be broken in two,
each piece will have in it the two magnetisms and the
two poles as the whole did. This is in entire contrast
with the electrical experiment noticed in the last of § 379.
4. There are no non-conductors to interrupt magnetic influence.
If in the experiments in § 379 a plate of glass
or resin were interposed between A and B, the influence
would cease, but it would have no effect on the induction
of magnetism if interposed between a magnet and
a bit of steel or iron.</p>

<p><a name="P_413" id="P_413"></a>
413. <b>Electro-Magnetism.</b>&mdash;Though electricity and magnetism
differ so much from each other, yet they have intimate
relations, and it is now the general opinion among
scientific men that they are merely different modes of
the same power. Magnetism can produce electricity,
and electricity can produce magnetism. The first discovery
of facts revealing this connection was made by
Professor Oersted of Copenhagen in 1819. Since that
time electro-magnetism, or the production of magnetism
by electricity, has been a prominent subject of observation
and experiment. Oersted's first observation was
that a current of electricity passing over a wire near a
magnetic needle affected the position of the needle. He
found also that iron filings would adhere to a wire over
which a current of electricity is passing, just as they do
to a magnet, dropping off, however, as soon as the current
ceases to pass. Such facts led to a great variety
of investigations and arrangements of apparatus by Oersted
and others.</p>

414. <b>Electro-Magnets.</b>&mdash;The most powerful electro-magnets
are made by bending a thick cylindrical bar of
soft iron into the form of a horseshoe, A B, Fig. 286, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
coiling around it a copper wire. The wire
must be insulated by being wound with
some non-conducting material, as silk, so
that the electric current may pass through
the whole length of the wire. With the
instrument thus prepared, if the two ends
of the wire be connected with the poles
of a voltaic battery which is in action,
the bar will be magnetized, and will hold
up a heavy weight so long as the electric
current is passing through the wire.
Whenever the current is cut off by disconnecting
the wires the weight will fall.
Electro-magnets have been made in this way having such
power as to sustain a weight of
four thousand pounds. In Fig.
287 we have represented an apparatus
which exhibits electro-magnetism
very prettily. The
soft iron, you see, is in two pieces
which when put together form a
ring, <em>d</em>, and each piece has a handle.
If the pieces be put together
with the coil, <em>c</em>, in the position
represented, on connecting the
wires P and N with a battery in
action, the adhesion is so strong as to resist a great
force; but as soon as the connection is broken the pieces
come apart at once.</p>

<p><a name="P_415" id="P_415"></a>
415. <b>Electric Telegraph.</b>&mdash;The most remarkable and
useful application of electro-magnetism we have in the
electric telegraph. As before stated, voltaic electricity
is used. This is generated at the place from which the
message is sent, and passes over the wire to the place
where the message is received. There it acts upon soft
iron by passing through coiled wire, producing the modified
power called electro-magnetism. I will make all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
plain to you by describing the machine used in Morse's
Telegraph, Fig. 288. W W are the wires which connect
with the station from which the message is to be received,
and these connect with the copper wire coiled
round the horseshoe of soft iron, <em>m m</em>. Above the magnet
is a lever, <em>a l</em>, which works on a fulcrum at <em>d</em>. One
end of this lever has a steel point, <em>s</em>, attached to it. At
<em>c</em> is an arrangement of wheel-work, the object of which
is to pass along regularly a slip of paper, <em>p</em>, in the direction
of the arrows. Observe now how the apparatus
works. When the electric current passes through the
coiled copper wire it makes a magnet of the iron, <em>m m</em>.
The lever, <em>a l</em>, is therefore attracted at the end, <em>a</em>, downward.
Of course the end, <em>l</em>, moves upward, bringing the
steel point, <em>s</em>, against the paper, where it makes a mark.
The length of this mark depends upon the length of time
the electricity is allowed to pass along the coiled wire,
for the moment that it is shut off <em>m m</em> ceases to be magnetic,
the "keeper," <em>a</em>, being no longer attracted, moves
upward, and the other end, <em>l</em>, of the lever moves downward,
taking the point, <em>s</em>, from the paper.</p>

</div>

<p>In order to make the marks on the paper of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
lengths, there is a contrivance for regulating the length
of time that the current shall pass through the coiled
wire. This contrivance, called
the <em>signal key</em> is represented
in Fig. 289. N and P are two
strips of brass connected with
the two wires R and M, of
which M comes from the battery.
The end of the strip N
is raised a little above the end of P. So long as they do
not touch the circuit is not complete, and no electricity
passes. But if the operator press N down upon P, the
circuit is established, and the electricity passes to the
station with which he is in communication, and there
acts upon the apparatus seen in Fig. 287. Now the
longer the finger presses down N upon P the longer will
be the mark on the paper at the distant station. An
operator then at New York, for example, controls by this
key the length of the marks made on the paper in New
Haven or any other place with which he is communicating.</p>

<p>You can see then very readily how a telegraphic alphabet
can be constructed by combinations of marks of
different lengths agreed upon to represent different letters
and numerals. I give the alphabet used in connection
with Morse's Telegraph:</p>

<p>One of the most singular and interesting things in the
operation of the telegraph remains to be noticed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
order to have the electricity work it is necessary to have
the connection between the poles of the battery at the
point where the effect is to be produced. You see this
in the experiments represented in Figs. 286 and 287.
The same is true of the electro-magnet of the telegraph.
This being so, it was thought at first that it was necessary
to have two wires connecting two communicating
stations; but it was found that only one wire was needed,
the earth itself answering the same purpose as another
wire. To make the communication through the
earth effectual, there is at each station a plate of metal,
having a surface of several square feet, buried in the
ground, with a wire running up to the machine.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I take the following from Dr. Arnot:</p>

<p>The reasons that so many people are drowned in ordinary cases,
who might easily he saved, are the following:</p>

<p>1. Their believing that continued exertion is necessary to keep the
body from sinking, and hence their generally assuming the position
of a swimmer, in which the face is downward, and the whole head
must be kept out of the water to allow of breathing. Now as a man
can not retain this position without continued exertion, he is soon exhausted,
even if a swimmer, and if not, the unskillful attempt will
scarcely secure for him even a few respirations. The body raised for
a moment by exertion above the natural level, sinks as far below when
the exertion ceases; and the plunge, by appearing the commencement
of a permanent sinking, terrifies the unpracticed individual, and renders
him an easier victim to his fate.</p>

<p>2. From a fear that water entering by the ears may drown as if it
entered by the nose or mouth, a wasteful exertion is made to prevent
it; the truth being, however, that it can only fill the outer ear, or as
far as the membrane of the drum, and is therefore of no consequence.</p>

<p>3. Persons unaccustomed to the water, and in danger of being
drowned, generally attempt in their struggle to keep their hands
above the surface, from feeling as if their hands were tied while held
below; but this act is most hurtful, because any part of the body kept
out of the water, in addition to the face, which must be so, requires
an effort to support it which the individual is supposed at the time
incompetent to afford.</p>

<p>4. Not having reflected that when a log of wood or a human body
is floating upright, with only a small portion above the surface, in
rough water, as at sea, every wave in passing must cover the head for
a little time, but will again leave it projecting in the interval. The
practiced swimmer chooses this interval for breathing.</p>

<p>5. Not knowing the importance of keeping the chest as full of air
as possible; the doing which has nearly the same effect as tying a
bladder of air to the neck, and without other effort will cause nearly
the whole head to remain above the water. If the chest be once
emptied, and if from the face being under water the person can not
inhale again, the body is then specifically heavier than water, and
will sink.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This is true except when the tube is so small that capillary attraction
exerts considerable influence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I was once consulted in regard to a smoking stove. It was an
open Franklin stove, the pipe of which went through a fire-board
into a monstrous chimney. I recommended that a pipe with a knee
should extend from the pipe of the stove a little way up the chimney.
The expedient was successful, because but a small body of air, that in
the pipe, needed to be heated to establish an upward current.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> As in the case of many other inventions, so here the same idea
was originated and put to practical use by more minds than one.
George Stephenson, who from being a common engine-wright in a
colliery rose step by step till he invented the locomotive, constructed
a lamp which illustrated in another way the same principle as the
lamp of Davy does&mdash;in other words, he invented another safety-lamp.
But this does not in the least detract from the glory which the invention
has given to the name of Davy, for each acted independently of
the other. In Davy's case, it is to be remarked, there was a long
course of scientific reasoning and investigation which led him at
length to the invention, the record of which is exceedingly interesting.
No invention or discovery is made without thought, though
accident may suggest the thought; but here is an invention which,
without any suggestion by accident, was evolved by laborious and
long-continued thought, proceeding step by step to its conclusion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> I will mention here a contrivance that I once adopted for a small
conservatory, which I wished to keep warm from the heat of a room
to which it was adjoining. In each space of the window-frames were
put two panes of glass, there being nearly half an inch of space between
them. In this way I secured all the benefit of double windows
with less expense and a less cumbrous arrangement. In mentioning
this contrivance now and then, casually, I have found that a few others
have thought of it, and adopted it with the same success that I
did.</p></div>

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
